In 1229, [the Council of Toulouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Toulouse) decree: 

> **We prohibit also that the laity should be permitted to have the books of the Old or New Testament**... we most strictly forbid their having any translation of these books.

This decree was issued to control religious teachings and to prevent "heretical" interpretations against the Roman Catholic Church.
