# Jewish Era


[The earliest known date of a canonical writing](/content/kingdom/bible/history.md) is the Book of Genesis which is estimated to be written around 1445-1405 BC by [Moses](/content/kingdom/bible/authors.md). Since Moses, many authoritative judges, kings and prophets contributed to the [Tanakh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Bible) (Hebrew bible). These books are written around the history of Israel, how the nation came into existence, the fall of Israel and how God maintained the remnant after the Babylonian exile, but also include important literature about God, His creation, wisdom, principles, laws, teachings, prophecies, blessings and songs which are very important to non-Jewish nations, even to the [Christians](/content/kingdom/bible/concepts/christian.md) in the modern era.

Bible books written between 400 BC and the birth of [Jesus](/content/kingdom/god/son.md) the [Christ](/content/kingdom/god/son/christ.md) are considered [Apocrypha](/content/kingdom/bible/books/apocrypha.md) by the Christian Protestants who do not accept the authority of these books and did not include them in their bibles, although the Catholic churches do accept these books.

Although God identified Himself in Hebrew as יְהוָ֖ה, which directly translates to the Tetragrammaton [YHVH](/content/kingdom/god/name/father.md#yhvh), we noticed that some time before the birth of Jesus (most likely during the Second Temple era), **the Jews replaced the God's name "YHVH" with "Adonai" which means "Lord" in /English**. This is also evident in the Greek manuscripts when the Jews refer to God as simply "Lord". 

Although scholars disagree on the exact date Jesus was born, all agree that it was around the time the Anno Domini year system switched from BC era years to AD era years. The Jews refuse to accept this system because the system starts counting from the birth of Jesus [Christ (Messiah)](/content/kingdom/bible/concepts/christ.md) whom they rejected.

In the Tanakh we read how the Israelites refused to approach God, how the temple was build and the priestly and sacrificial system was introduced to cleanse people from their sin in order to be [righteous](/content/kingdom/bible/concepts/righteousness.md) with God.

While Jesus was alive, he taught, demonstrated and set moral standards to many disciples (mainly Jews) to follow his teachings which include
* fresh revelations on how people aught to interpret the Mosaic laws, with the focus on love and [righteous](/content/kingdom/bible/concepts/righteousness.md) with God and their neighbours, instead of obeying religious rituals
* he gave people a fresh perspective of [Who God is](/content/kingdom/god/father.md) (His character) and what [God's plan](/content/kingdom/bible/concepts/word.md) or motives are for humanity
* the revelation of God's kingdom
* the gospel of [salvation](/content/kingdom/eternal/saved.md) which means people do not need priests and rituals to be saved
* warnings and prophecies about the future

These teachings caused a stir in the Jewish community of his time and he eventually received the death sentence for [claiming to be the Christ](/content/kingdom/god/son/essence/as-god/witnesses/accusers.md) which according to the Jewish priests were considered "[blasphemy](/content/kingdom/bible/concepts/blasphemy.md)" which was punishable by death.

Many scholars agree that Jesus was ["crucified"](/content/kingdom/bible/symbolism/cross.md) around AD 30–33.
