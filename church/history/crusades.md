# The Crusades


In 1071, [the Byzantine Empire lost territory to the Muslims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusades) after the Battle of Manzikert. Therefore, [the empire used religious motivations in attempt to regain control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusades) of *"the holy places"* (Israel). Religious motivations included:
* Defending Christianity
* **[Securing salvation through participation in the Crusades](https://smarthistory.org/how-was-crusading-justified-2-of-4/)**

The popes continued to call for these Crusades as *"God's will"*.

In addition, there was also economical motivations, such as merchants seeking control over trade routes and opportunities to profit from transporting crusaders.
