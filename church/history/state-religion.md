# The Roman Catholic state religion


In 379 [Theodosius I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodosius_I) became [emperor and co-reigned](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Theodosius-I) with [Gratian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratian).

In February 380, the Edict of Thessalonica declared [Nicene Christianity the state religion](https://revelationbyjesuschrist.com/theodosius/), criminalising Arianism and other heresies.

On 24 November 380, [Theodosius expelled Demophilus](https://www.catholic.com/encyclopedia/theodosius-i), the last Arian bishop of Constantinople. 

In January 381, [Theodosius closed Arian chapels](https://revelationbyjesuschrist.com/theodosius/) which resulted in a riot by the citizens.

## The Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed

In July 381, the First Council of Constantinople expanded [the Nicaea Creed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicene_Creed) to address Arianism disputes. This version is:

> * We believe in one God, the Father Almighty, the maker of heaven and earth, of things visible and invisible.
> * And in one Lord Jesus Christ,
>   * the Son of God, the begotten of God the Father,
>   * the Only-begotten,
>   * **that is of the substance of the Father**.
>   * **God** of God, Light of Light,
>   * **true God** of true God,
>   * **begotten and not made; of the very same nature of the Father**,
>   * by **Whom all things came into being, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible**.
>   * Who for us humanity and for our salvation came down from heaven, was **incarnate**, became human, was born perfectly of the holy virgin Mary by the Holy Spirit.
>   * By whom He took body, soul, and mind, and everything that is in man, truly and not in semblance.
>   * He suffered, was crucified, was buried, rose again on the third day, ascended into heaven with the same body, [and] sat at the right hand of the Father.
>   * He is to come with **the same body** and with the glory of the Father, to judge the living and the dead;
>   * of His kingdom there is no end.
> * We believe in the Holy Spirit,
>   * the uncreate and the perfect;
>   * Who spoke through the Law, the prophets, and the Gospels;
>   * Who came down upon the Jordan,
>   * preached through the apostles, and
>   * lived in the saints.
> * We believe also in only One, **Universal, Apostolic, and [Holy] Church**;
> *   in one baptism with repentance for the remission and forgiveness of sins;
> *   and in the resurrection of the dead,
> *   in the everlasting judgement of souls and bodies,
> *   in the Kingdom of Heaven and in the everlasting life.
