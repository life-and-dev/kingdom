# The introduction of Sunday Rest


During the Constantinian dynasty, **[institutional roles like the pope, bishops and clerics gradually evolved to maintain order in the church](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Christianity/The-alliance-between-church-and-empire)**.

At that time Judaism was considered a rival religion to the Christianity in the Roman Empire and the church decided to [institutionalise antisemitism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church_and_Judaism) to intensify Jewish prosecution.

## The council of Laodicea

Therefore, in 363-364 [the council of Laodicea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Laodicea), a Christian synod of 30 clerics from Asia Minor, regulated the conduct of church members by decrees in the form of written rules. This includes:
* **Determining the church order and behaviour of bishops, clerics and laypeople**
* Regulating the approach to heretics and Jews
* **Outlawing the keeping of the Sabbath (resting on Saturday)** to distinct themselves from "Jewish practices"
* **Encourage rest on Sundays**
* Outlining liturgical practices
* Restrictions during lent (a religious observance before Easter Sunday)
* The process how individuals are prepared for baptism and admission to the church
* [Specify the biblical canon](/content/kingdom/bible/books.md)

> "[Christians](/content/kingdom/bible/concepts/christian.md) must not [Judaize and rest on the Sabbath](/content/kingdom/bible/interpretations/day-of-rest.md), but **must work on that day**, if possible;   
> but *the Lord's day* they must especially honour, and, as far as possible, must refrain from work. **If any one be found Judaizing, let him be anathema**."
