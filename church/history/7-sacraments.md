# The 7 Sacraments


In 1215, [the Fourth Lateran Council](https://www.catholic.org/encyclopedia/view.php?id=6883) was convened by Pope Innocent III and was attended by over 400 bishops from all over Europe. The council's decree on **7 sacraments that are necessary for [salvation](/content/kingdom/eternal/saved.md)**, namely:

1. Baptism
2. Confirmation
3. Eucharist
4. Penance
5. Extreme Unction *(now called "Anointing of the Sick")*
6. Holy Orders
7. Matrimony

> There is indeed one universal church of the faithful, **outside of which nobody at all is saved**. -- [Lateran IV, 1](https://catholicstand.com/did-vatican-ii-change-the-doctrine-no-salvation-outside-the-church/)

This was reaffirmed in 1442, by [the Council of Florence which declared](https://www.papalencyclicals.net/councils/ecum17.htm):

> It firmly believes, professes and preaches that all those who are outside the catholic church, not only pagans but also Jews or heretics and schismatics, cannot share in eternal life and **will go into the everlasting fire** which was prepared for the devil and his angels, **unless they are joined to the catholic church before the end of their lives**; that the unity of the ecclesiastical body is of such importance that only for **those who abide in it do the churchâ€™s sacraments contribute to salvation** and do fasts, almsgiving and other works of piety and practices of **the Christian militia produce eternal rewards**; and that nobody can be saved, no matter how much he has given away in alms and even if he has shed his blood in the name of Christ, **unless he has persevered in the bosom and the unity of the catholic church**.
