# Other influences


## Protestant Influences

### Jan Hus

Jan Hus, a former priest and university master from Bohemia, was influence by [John Wycliffe](/content/kingdom/church/history/wycliffe.md)'s writings.

Jan believed:
* that **the Bible scriptures took precedence over church leaders and councils**. This questioned the Church's authority,
* that **only Christ could be the head of the Church**. He argued that God, through His scripture, was the final authority,
* that the **simoniacal practices (selling pardons for sin, positions in church or other spiritual "benefits")** was wrong,
* that **Christians could communicate directly with God**.

Jan were put on trial and on 6 July 1415, he was condemned as a ***heretic*** and sentenced to death before the entire Council of Constance.

### Martin Luther

Martin Luther [nailed 95 theses](https://www.worldhistory.org/article/1891/martin-luthers-95-theses/) on the door of the Wittenberg Castle Church on 31 October 1517. In short, Martin wrote:

* "[Repentance](/content/kingdom/eternal/saved/repent.md)" is "the whole life of believers should be repentance", not "sacramental penance administrated by the priests"
* The pope cannot forgive sin against God.
* No one can repent on behalf of the dead.
* He condemns priests who claim to be able to forgive or reverse forgiveness of sin.
* The pope does not hold the keys of death.
* No one can buy souls out of purgatory.
* Every Christian has the right to forgiveness of sin without letters of pardon.
* Every Christian has the right to the blessings of Christ and the Church even without letters of pardon.
* Christians should be taught that he who gives to the poor or lends to the needy does a better work than buying pardons.
* Christians should be taught to first take care of their own families, and by no means squander it on pardons.
* There are no commandment to buy pardons.
* The assurance of salvation by letters of pardon is vain, even by the pope himself.
* Preachers should preach about the Word of God, not about pardons.
* The Gospel is much more important than pardons.
* The true treasure of the Church should not be the money collected by pardons, but "the Most Holy Gospel of the glory and the grace of God"
* Men should not be fished for riches.
* Martin cursed those who lie about pardons and bless those who speak against the lust and license of pardon-preachers.
* The bishops, curates and theologians who allowed blasphemy by teaching that the cross emblazoned with the papal arms are of equal worth than the cross of Christ, will have an account to render.
* These teachings ridicule the Church and the pope and make Christians unhappy, by logic questions:
  * "Why does not the pope empty purgatory for the sake of love to the souls there in?"
  * "How is it fair that one soul could be saved by money and the other not?"
  * "Why does the pope who is richer that the richest, built just one church with his own money, rather than with the money of the poor believers?"
  * "Why do the pope not forgive every believer's sin?"
  * "Why does the pope seek money when he is supposed to seek salvation of souls?"
* Martin curse the prophets who say "Peace, peace" and there is no peace, but bless the prophets who say "Cross, cross" and there is no cross.
* Christians should follow Christ as their Head, through penalties, deaths and hell and should be confident of entering into heaven through many tribulations, than through the assurance of peace.

This act started the Protestant Reformation which reformed the following:

* The acknowledged that souls were saved without penitence and confession (which they considered sin), but **by faith and the grace of God**.
* **Scripture was the sole authority.**
* Scripture should be taught in **the local language** of the community.
* The **new church structure was now focused around the local preacher** instead of a central hierarchy.
* Two sacraments were kept, but altered (depending on the denomination), namely:
  * [Baptism](/content/kingdom/eternal/saved/baptize.md)
  * [Communion / Lord's Supper](/content/kingdom/life/communion.md)
* Five sacraments were downgraded/removed (depending on the denomination):
  * Confirmation
  * Penance
  * Ordination
  * Marriage (still considered as an ordinance of God, but no longer a sacrament)
  * Anointing of the Sick (extreme unction)
* **Rejected 7 books of the Catholic Bible**, namely Baruch, Judith, 1 & 2 Maccabees, Sirach, Tobit and Wisdom.

The Protestant Reformation also motivated King Henry VIII to declare the Church of England (Anglican Church) independent of Rome so that:
* Each national church enjoys a measure of autonomy with the head as the Archbishop of Canterbury.
* Priests were allowed to marry.
* Rejected the papal supremacy.
* Rejected 7 books of the Catholic Bible.

Today, Lutheranism is the official religion of several countries, including Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Iceland, and Finland.

The Lutheranism theology includes:

* Eucharist: **Is a real presence of Christ's body and blood**.
* Bishops: **Govern the church**.
* Rejects predestination theology of [Calvanism](#calvanism).

### Anabaptists

In 1525, the Swiss reformers, Conrad Grebel, Felix Manz, and George Blaurock, baptized themselves as adults with immersion. This was s a radical break from the Catholic tradition and started the Anabaptist reformation.

The Anabaptist theology includes:
* Adult believer baptism: It means baptism should be a conscious choice by adults who already come to faith with Jesus Christ.
* Separation of church and state: It means the church should not be involved in the government and politics.
* Pacifism: It means Christians should not participate in war or violence.
* Community of goods: All members of the community share their possessions and resources.

In addition:
* They take the bible literally
* Place a great emphasis on discipleship, community and social justice

### Calvanism

In 1536, John Calvin, a French theologian, pastor and reformer in Geneva, wrote his first book "Institutes of the Christian Religion" which contains his theological beliefs and addressed many issues that the Protestant Church experienced. This shaped the Calvanism branch of the Protestant Reformation, which includes:

* Sovereignty of God: This means nothing happens without God's will.
* Authority of Scripture: This means the Bible is the only source of religious authority.
* Predestination: This means **God has predestined some people for salvation and others for damnation.** This results in the **"once saved, always saved"** doctrine.
* Justification by faith: This means people are saved by grace through **faith in Jesus Christ, not by their own works.**
* Total depravity: This means all people are born sinners and are incapable of saving themselves.
* The church: Is a community of people who believers who are the body of Christ.
* Infant baptism: He believed **everyone must be baptised** even if you do not understand it, however he acknowledged that infant baptism does not save.
* Eucharist: Is a symbolic memorial of Christ's death and resurrection.
* Council of elders: Govern the church instead of a bishop.

These theologies and writing are still studied today by theologians in Protestant Churches.

### Puratins

In 1547, the Puratin Movement gained momentum under the reign of Edward VI. The Puratin's goal was to "purify" the Church of England of the Roman Catholic remnants.

During Edward VI's reign: 

* He appointed Protestant reformers to key positions in the Church of England
* The Book of Common Prayer was revised, which was a Protestant liturgy that replaced the traditional Catholic Mass
* He ordered the destruction of Catholic shrines and images
* He supported the persecution of Catholics

Some of the influences of the Puratins were:

* They rejected the authority of the Pope: The Puritans did not recognize the Pope as the head of the church. They believed that each **congregation was autonomous and should be governed by its own elders**.
* They simplified the church service: The Puritans **removed many of the elaborate rituals and ceremonies** that were part of the Catholic Mass. They replaced these rituals with a simpler service that focused on preaching and prayer.
* They emphasized the importance of preaching: The Puritans believed that **preaching was the most important part of the church service**. They wanted their ministers to be able to explain the Bible clearly and concisely.
* They promoted education: The Puritans believed that **education was essential for Christians** to understand the Bible. They established schools and colleges to educate their children.
* They created a strict moral code: The Puritans had a strict moral code that they expected all Christians to follow. They **condemned many activities such as dancing, drinking, gambling, theater-going, swearing, Sabbath-breaking**.

### Socinianism

[John Assheton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Assheton), a former Anglican priest, rejected the Trinitarian doctrine, but was forced to recant before [Thomas Cranmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Cranmer) in 1548.

On 16 February 1553, [Michael Servetus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Servetus), was denounced as a heretic, for rejecting the Trinitarian doctrine, by Guillaume de Trie (a rich merchant who had taken refuge in Geneva and who was a good friend of Calvin). [Martin Luther](#martin-luther) also condemned his writing which later influenced the Socinian movement. On 24 October, Servetus was sentenced to death by burning, by orders of John Calvin, for denying the Trinity and infant baptism. His last words were "Jesus, Son of the Eternal God, have mercy on me".

Servetus' ideas were spread by Italian humanists who had fled to Poland and Transylvania to escape religious persecution.

Soon the Socinianism movement started by Lelio and Fausto Sozzini. In the 1580's, Fausto Sozzini, published his writings which influenced [Remonstrant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remonstrant) movement.

### Unitarianism

Although the [Unitarian movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitarianism) started almost simultaneously with the Protestant Reformation, it was only in 1568, that [the first Unitarian Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitarian_Church_of_Transylvania), was founded in the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom by the Unitarian preacher and theologian [Ferenc Dávid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferenc_D%C3%A1vid).

The Unitarian theology rejection of the Trinity doctrine (of God is 3 persons in 1 Godhead). Unitarians believe there is only one God who is one person.

### King James I

In the early 17th century, England was religiously divided with great tensions between the Catholics, Protestants and Puritans.

Therefore, in 1604, King James I authorized 47 scholars and clergymen to create the [King James Version Bible](/content/kingdom/bible/translations/kjv.md) with the aim to:

* To promote religious unity: There different English translations in circulation, each with its own theological biases causing division
* To enhance his own authority: To proof that he as the king was God's chosen ruler and to assert to be the head of the Church of England
* To make the Bible more accessible to common people

This is significant because many modern English bible translations are based on this translation.

## Other reformations and movements

### The Baptist Reformation

In 1608, John Smyth, a former Anglican priest, served as a pastor of a Puritan Separist congregation in Gainesborough, England, fled to Amsterdam with his congregation to escape the persecution of King James and joined a Dutch [Anabaptist](#anabaptists) group.

1 year later Smyth became convinced that the New Testament taught **baptism was for believers and not infants**. He baptized himself, disbanded the congregation and reconstitute a new church which is generally considered the first Baptist church.

John's Smyth's Baptist church differ from the Anabaptists in regard of:
* They did not believe in the literal interpretation of the bible.
* They did not practice the community of goods.

### The Religious Society of Friends

In 1647, George Fox, a young shoemaker from Leicestershire in England, experienced a profound spiritual awakening and began preaching his beliefs about the inner light of God within each person.

In 1652, George Fox, officially founded the Religious Society of Friends (also known as the "Quakers").

In 1660, the first Quaker meeting house is built in England. However, it was also during this period that the Quaker persecution intensified. It is estimated that about 15,000 Quakers were jailed in England between 1660 and 1685.

In 1681, William Penn, a Quaker, founds the colony of Pennsylvania, which becomes a safe haven for Quakers that had been persecuted by other American colonies. Many years later the Quakers played a key role in the American Revolution, advocating for non-violence and abolitionism.

In 1848, [The Seneca Falls Convention](https://www.history.com/topics/womens-history/seneca-falls-convention), a landmark event in the women's suffrage movement, was organized by Quakers.

Quakers belief in:

* Inner Light: Quakers belief that each individual possesses an "inner light" of God, which guides their conscience and leads them towards truth and righteousness in contrast to scripture and church authority like other Christian denominations.
* Simplicity: Quakers practice a life of simplicity, both in their personal lives and their worship. They avoid ostentatious displays of wealth or status, and their meeting houses are typically plain and unadorned. This emphasis on simplicity reflects their belief that true spirituality comes from within, not from external things.
* Pacifism: Quakers are known for their commitment to pacifism and nonviolence. They believe that all human life is sacred and that violence is never justified, even in self-defense or war. This commitment to peace has led them to take active roles in peace building initiatives and social justice movements around the world.
* Equality: Quakers believe in the inherent equality of all people, regardless of race, gender, or social status. This belief has led them to be strong advocates for social justice and equality throughout their history.
* Direct Worship: Quakers worship in a simple and unprogrammed manner. They gather in silence to wait upon God, and anyone may speak as they feel moved by the Holy Spirit. This directness and lack of formal liturgy contrasts with the more structured worship services of many other Christian denominations.
* Decision-Making: Quakers use a process of consensus decision-making, where all members of a group have the opportunity to voice their opinions and participate in the decision-making process. This emphasis on consensus reflects their belief in the equality of all individuals and the importance of seeking God's guidance in their decisions.
* Social Activism: Quakers have a long history of social activism, working to address issues such as poverty, war, racial injustice, and environmental destruction. Their commitment to social justice stems from their belief in the inherent worth of all people and their responsibility to love and serve their neighbors.

### Methodism

In the 1730's John Wesley, an Anglican priest, who preached outdoors and to formed small groups of people who were committed to living a holy life, which later became known as Methodist societies.

What makes the Methodist theology distinct from earlier reformations is the Entire Sanctification Theology. This means, it is a state of holiness, which means believers should constantly strive to live in accordance with God's will and to become like Christ. This state of holiness is blessing that can only be achieved by the Holy Spirit.

In addition, John Wesley taught that God wanted his people to be prosperous, and he believed that this prosperity was a sign of God's favor. This is seen by many as one of the earliest "Prosperity Gospel Preachers".

John's brother, Charles Wesley wrote more than 6000 hymns to express the message of revival.

In 1795, the Methodist completely broke away from the Anglican Church (Church of England).

The Wesleyan Methodist Church grew rapidly to 450,000 members during the next century especially in the industrial areas, where they helped workers to endure economic hardship while they alleviated their poverty.

### The Plymouth Brethren movement

In 1825, a group of Christians in Dublin, including Anthony Norris Groves, Edward Cronin, and John Gifford Bellett, began meeting regularly for prayer, Bible study, and fellowship, known as the Plymouth Brethren Movement.

In 1827, John Nelson Darby, a former Anglican clergyman, joined the Plymouth Brethren Movement. He argued that the Bible taught a **pretribulational rapture**, and he convinced many other Christians of this view. Darby's leadership and teachings attracted a growing number of followers, and the movement spread to England and other parts of the world.

In 1970, Hal Lindsey, an American Christian author and theologian published his book "The Late Great Planet Earth" which became a bestseller, selling over 30 million copies worldwide and introducing millions to the concept of a pretribulational rapture. His popularity helped to mainstream the pretribulational rapture view, making it a widely accepted belief among many Christians.

### The Mormon movement

On 6 April 1830, the Mormon Church, also known as the "Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints" (LDS), was founded in Fayette, Seneca County, New York, by Joseph Smith who claimed to have received a series of revelations from God, which is contained in **new scriptures found in the Book of Mormon**. The church quickly grew and spread throughout the United States, and it eventually established itself in other parts of the world as well.

In 1839, Smith and his followers were driven out of Missouri and eventually settled in Nauvoo, Illinois.

In 1844, Smith was killed by a mob in Carthage, Illinois. After Smith's death, the church split into several factions, and the largest of these factions, led by Brigham Young, eventually settled in Utah.

Today, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has over 16 million members worldwide.

Mormons differ from traditional Christians on:
* Scriptures: **Mormons include the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of the Prince** which are not included in Christian Bibles.
* Nature of God: Mormons believe that **God is a physical being with a body.**
* Nature of Jesus: Mormons believe that **Jesus Christ is the human son of God**.
* Plan of salvation: Mormons believe that **all people were spirit children of God before they were born on earth, and that they have the potential to become like God**.
* Role of the Church: Mormons believe that **the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the only true church on earth**.
* Mormon Practises: **Baptism for the dead, temple sealing, and polygamy (which was banned in 1890).**
* Salvation: Mormons believe that people are saved through faith in Jesus Christ and **by keeping the commandments of God**.

### The Seventh-Day Adventist Church

In 1831, William Miller, a Baptist convert, predicted that the Second coming of Jesus Christ would occur in 1844 based on his interpretation of the Book of Daniel. However, when the Second coming of the Jesus Christ did not occur, the Great Disappointment led to a period of confusion and disarray among the Millerites. This caused Hiram Edson, Ellen and James White, Joseph Bates, and J. N. Andrews to study the Bible together, so that they came to a number of new understandings about the Bible:

* The seventh-day Sabbath: They believe that **the seventh-day Sabbath is a perpetual commandment from God**, and that it should be observed as a day of rest and worship.
* The second coming of Christ: They believe that Jesus Christ will return to earth a second time to establish his eternal kingdom. They teach that **this event is imminent** and that Christians should be prepared for it.
* The state of the dead: They believe that **the dead are unconscious until the resurrection**, at which time they will be judged according to their works.
* The sanctuary: They believe that **the sanctuary in heaven is a literal place** where Christ is ministering as our High Priest.
* The investigative judgment: They believe that **Christ is currently conducting an investigative judgment** in heaven, determining who will be saved and who will be lost.

In 1863, this group officially organized into a new denomination, called the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Today this denomination has grown to over 25 million members in over 200 countries and territories.

### The New Apostolic Church

In 1863, the New Apostolic Church (NAC) was founded in Hamburg, Germany, by a group of Christians who split from the Catholic Apostolic Church. 

The NAC believes that God is still raising up apostles and prophets today, and that these leaders have a unique authority in the church. The NAC also emphasizes the importance of the sacraments, including baptism, holy communion, and sealing.

### The Convocation of Canterbury

In 1870, the Convocation of Canterbury, an assembly of the bishops and clergy of the Church of England, appointed more than 50 scholars to write the English Revised Version (ERV) because:
* The last few centuries, significant advances were made in their understanding of the original Hebrew and Greek texts. 
* The English language has changed since the [KJV](/content/kingdom/bible/translations/kjv.md) Bible was written, thus they wanted to make the bible more accessible to modern readers.

The project was completed in 1885. This is significant because many modern Bible translations are based on this Bible translation which includes:

* American Standard Version (ASV) (1901)
* Revised Standard Version (RSV) (1946)
* New American Standard Bible (NASB) (1971)
* New Revised Standard Version (NRSV) (1989)
* English Standard Version (ESV) (2001)
* New English Translation (NET) (2005)
* New International Version (NIV) (2011)
* World Messianic Bible (WMB) (2015)

### Jehovah Witnesses

In 1872, the Jehovah Witnesses were found by Charles Taze Russell in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. They were originally known as the International Bible Students Association (IBSA). Russell published a magazine called the Watch Tower, which contained his teachings on the Bible and caused the International Bible Students Association to grew rapidly.  Today it is estimated that there are over 8 million Jehovah Witness members in 200 countries worldwide.

Russell originally believed that **Jesus Christ would return to Earth in 1874**, which like [the Millerites](#the-seventh-day-adventist-church), caused a huge disappointment among his followers. However, today the Jehovah Witnesses do not predict a date for Jesus' return.

In addition, Russel taught that:
* Rejection of the Trinity: God is one person, **Jehovah**.
* Christ's Nature: Russell believed that **Jesus Christ was a created being**, the firstborn son of God, and that **Jesus was not equal to God the Father**.
* Ransom Sacrifice: Russell taught that Jesus Christ's death on the cross was not a sacrifice to appease God's anger, but rather **a ransom sacrifice to pay off the debt of sin** that humanity owed to God. This ransom sacrifice, according to Russell, made it possible for God to offer salvation to those who exercised faith in Jesus.
* Conditional Immortality: Russell rejected the traditional Christian belief in the immortality of the soul. Instead, he taught that the human soul is mortal and that **only those who are chosen by God will be resurrected to everlasting life**.
* **Rejection of Traditional Observances**: Russell rejected many traditional Christian observances, such as Christmas, Easter, and the celebration of birthdays. He considered these observances to be of pagan origin and not in harmony with biblical teachings.
* **Door-to-Door Evangelism**: Russell emphasised the importance of door-to-door evangelism as a means of spreading the good news of God's Kingdom. This practice, which continues to be a hallmark of the Jehovah's Witnesses, has been met with criticism from some who view it as intrusive or disrespectful.
* **Governing Body Leadership**: Russell established a central governing body to oversee the activities of the IBSA. This governing body, which continues to lead the Jehovah's Witnesses, has been criticised for its lack of transparency and its control over the organisation's affairs.
* **Interpretation of Bible Prophecy**: Jehovah witness interpret every bible prophecy very literally, for example they believe that **only 144,000 people will be saved to live in heaven with Jesus Christ**, while the remaining believers will live on Earth in the restored paradise.

### Pentecostal Movement

In 1906, William J. Seymour, an African American minister, founded the first Pentecostal church, the Apostolic Faith Church of Azusa Street.

Their church was different from the traditional Protestant churches in the sense that they believed that baptism in the Holy Spirit empowers believers to speak in tongues, heal the sick, and perform other miracles.

The Pentecostal theology includes:
* **The Holy Spirit is a distinct person in the Godhead who empowers them to do miracles**
* Emphasis on direct or **personal experience with God**
* Emphasis on evangelism: it's a duty to share the gospel of Jesus Christ with others

## Modern Messianic Movement

In 1881, Joseph Rabinovitz, a Russian Jew who converted to Christianity. Rabinovitz returned to Russia and founded the first Messianic congregation in Kishinev, Moldova, in 1887.

In 1908, Rabbi Hyman Aaron Cohen, a Russian Jew who immigrated to the United States, founded the Messianic Jewish Alliance of America.

In 1948, the State of Israel was established. This leads to a renewed interest in Messianic Judaism among Jewish people.

In 1973, "Jews for Jesus", was founded by a Jewish man, Martin "Moishe" Rosen.

In 1998, Dr. David H. Stern translated the Complete Jewish Bible (CJB) which contained paraphrased version of the Jewish Publication Society version of the Tanakh of 1917. His purpose was to restore God's Word to its original Jewish context and culture as well as be in easily read modern English, yet make the Bible more accessible to Jewish readers by using Hebrew and Yiddish expressions, and by translating the names of people and places in their Hebrew forms.

In 2009, the Institute for Scripture Research (ISR) in South Africa, published that latest version of "The Scriptures" Bible translation. It is a literal translation of the Bible in English, with a focus on restoring the original book order of the Hebrew Scriptures (Tanakh) and the Name of the Most High (YHWH) throughout. The Hebrew source texts for the Scriptures include the Masoretic Text (MT) and the Dead Sea Scrolls. The Greek source texts for the Scriptures include the Textus Receptus (TR) and the Nestle-Aland (NA).

In 2013, created by Tov Rose, published the New Messianic Version Bible (NMV) with the purpose to make the KJV more accessible to modern readers without sacrificing accuracy or faithfulness to the original texts.

Today, there are an estimated 350,000 Messianic Jews worldwide.

It is important to note that the Messianic Movement is a diverse group, but commonly they believe Jesus is the [Messiah](/content/kingdom/bible/concepts/christ.md).

### The Old Apostolic Church

In 1921 Friedrich Wilhelm, a former member of the Catholic Apostolic Church, founded the Old Apostolic Church (OAC) in Germany. Ironically, the ***Old*** Apostolic Church is newer than the ***New*** Apostolic Church. The name "Old Apostolic Church" is meant to reflect the OAC's belief that it has preserved the apostolic teachings and practices more faithfully than other Christian denominations.

Schwartz denomination belief:

* Exclusivity: The OAC believes that it is the only true church, and that **[salvation](/content/kingdom/eternal/saved.md) is only possible through membership in the OAC**.
* Sacraments: The OAC practices a number of sacraments, including baptism, communion, and holy matrimony. The church believes that these **sacraments are essential for [salvation](/content/kingdom/eternal/saved.md)**.
* Strict moral codes: The OAC has a number of strict social codes, dress codes and other moral codes, such as a **prohibition on divorce, alcohol, tobacco, movies, dancing, and gambling**.
* Leadership structure: The OAC has a **hierarchical leadership structure**, with apostles and prophets at the top.

Today, the OAC has over 1 million members worldwide.

## Faith Movement

> The Christian ["Faith Movement"](/content/kingdom/life/faith.md), also known as the "Word of Faith" or "Prosperity Gospel" movement, began to take shape in the mid-20th century, primarily in the United States. While its roots can be traced to earlier ideas, the movement gained significant momentum and prominence in the 1940s and 1950s.
Key figures and developments in the emergence of this movement include:
>
> * E.W. Kenyon (1867-1948): Often considered a forerunner of the movement, Kenyon's teachings on faith and positive confession influenced later prosperity preachers.
> * Kenneth Hagin (1917-2003): Widely regarded as the "father" of the Word of Faith movement, Hagin popularized many of Kenyon's ideas starting in the 1960s.
> * Oral Roberts (1918-2009): While not strictly a Word of Faith preacher, Roberts' emphasis on prosperity and "seed faith" concepts in the 1950s and 1960s contributed to the movement's development.
> * Kenneth Copeland (born 1936): Became a prominent figure in the movement in the 1970s and continues to be influential today.
> * Televangelism: The rise of religious television programming in the 1960s and 1970s provided a platform for prosperity preachers to reach wider audiences.
>
> The movement gained significant traction in the 1980s and has since become a notable, though controversial, strand within modern Christianity.

### The Universal Church of the Kingdom of God

On 9 July 1977, Bishop Edir Macedo, a former Catholic, founded the "Universal Church of the Kingdom of God" (UCKG) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Critics have accused the church of being **a money-making operation that exploits the poor**. They have also criticized Macedo's teachings on **prosperity theology**. 

The UCKG teaches:

* Emphasis on prosperity gospel: The UCKG teaches that **Christians can achieve financial prosperity through prayer and faith** (also known as "prosperity gospel").
* Emphasis on tithing: The UCKG teaches that **Christians are obligated to tithe**, which means giving 10% of their income to the church. This is a higher tithe than is typically required by traditional Christian churches.
* Control of the Holy Spirit: The UCKG believes that **the Holy Spirit is a powerful force that can be used to heal people and solve problems**.
* Speaking of tongues: The UCKG **encourages its members to speak in tongues**.

Today, the UCKG has over 12 million members in more than 150 countries.
