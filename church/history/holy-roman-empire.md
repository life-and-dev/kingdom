# The Holy Roman Epire


In 756, Pope Stephen II allied with the Frankish King, Pippin the Short, to [gain independence from the Byzantine Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donation_of_Pepin).

On 25 December 800, [the pope crowned Charlemagne, King of the Franks as emperor](https://courses.lumenlearning.com/atd-herkimer-westerncivilization/chapter/the-coronation-of-800-ce/) of the Holy Roman Empire at St. Peter's Basilica in Rome to reunite various regions of the [former Western Roman Empire](/content/kingdom/church/history/dark-ages.md) under a common rule. 

The Holy Roman Empire lasted until 1806. [This was significant](https://www.medievalists.net/2010/12/the-significance-of-the-coronation-of-charlemagne/) because:

* Set **a precedent for papal involvement in imperial politics** which strengthen the Roman Catholic Church's power
* Suppress any religious practises against the Roman Catholic Church
* Spread Roman Catholic Christianity across Europe
