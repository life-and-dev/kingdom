# Valentine's Day

> While it’s debated by some modern scholars, it was believed by others that there was a matchmaking lottery associated with the Lupercalia festival.

There are many different legends about Saint Valentine, but the most famous one is that he wrote a letter to a blind girl named Julia, who was the daughter of his jailer.
