# Bible Modifications


The [Church History](/content/kingdom/church/history.md) have a significant impact on how translators interpret and modified the Bible to fit their doctrines.

# Changes to support the Trinity doctrine
* [God's name was removed](/content/kingdom/god/father/name.md) (which blur the difference between God with Jesus).
* Some bibles capitalised all references to Jesus to [imply that Jesus is God](/content/kingdom/god/son/essence/as-god.md).
* ["The Word"](/content/kingdom/bible/concepts/word.md) is capitalised to imply that Jesus as God.
* "The Word" and "the Holy Spirit" were personified in favour of the [Trinity doctrine](/content/kingdom/bible/doctrines/trinitarian.md).
* Adding words to the bible in favour of [the Trinity](/content/kingdom/bible/doctrines/trinitarian.md), for example compare 1 John 5:7-8 in KJV with other translations like ESV, NIV, NLT, NASB95, DARBY, CSB, HCSB.
* Unrelated cross-references were added, for example supposed [references to Jesus in the Old Testament](/content/kingdom/bible/books/psalms.md) to "proof" that Jesus is God.
* Some bibles print Jesus' words in a bold red colour, but God's words are printed in the usual font, for example [Luke 3:22 NIV](https://www.biblica.com/bible/niv/luke/3/). This gives the impression that only Jesus is God or that Jesus' words are more important than God's.
* The ["with" preposition was changed to "in"](/content/kingdom/bible/translations/differences/en.md) (to make Jesus seem more god-like).

# Changes to make the bible less Jewish or more Christian
* Persons' names were changed (to make it English, but lost the meaning of those names).
* Books' names were changed (to make it less Jewish, but it distorts the purpose of some books).
* The division between the Old Testament and the New Testament (to deprecate the "Jewish laws" as being taught by [the book of Hebrew](/content/kingdom/bible/books/hebrews.md)).
* Certain keywords were changed for example:
  * "assembly of Jesus' disciples" → "church" (this replaces discipleship or [the body of Christ](/content/kingdom/body.md) with a church system)
  * "Messiah" → ["Christ"](/content/kingdom/bible/concepts/christ.md) (in favour of Christianity)
  * "Torah" → "law" (to discourages people to study the deprecated those "Jewish laws" of the "Old" Testament)
* Terms like "the cross" and "crucifixion" were added in favour of Christianity which is identified with a [cross symbol](/content/kingdom/bible/symbolism/cross.md).
* Names like ["communion", "the Lord's Supper", "Eucharist"](/content/kingdom/life/communion/terminology.md) were invented for modern ceremonies that replaced "Jewish" feasts.

# Changes made for convenience
* Some [books were omitted](/content/kingdom/bible/books/apocrypha.md) (to support the early church father's views).
* Some [books were added](/content/kingdom/bible/books.md) (to support the early church father's views).
* The order of the books were changed (to find popular books first at the cost of the chronological order of events).
* Chapters and verses were added (to lookup verses quickly, but at the cost of losing the context of the text).
* Footnotes and titles were added in favour of the translator's views.
* Certain keywords were changed for example:
  * "the authority of ..." → ["the name of ..."](/content/kingdom/bible/concepts/name.md) (it is easier to call a magic "name", than to submit under authority)
  * "revelation of a secret" → ["mystery"](/content/kingdom/bible/concepts/mystery.md) (to escape contradictions)
* Punctuation and quotation makes were added according to the translator's view (for example compare John 3 in different bible translations where it is [unclear where Jesus' dialogue stops and where John's commentary starts](/content/kingdom/god/son/essence/as-god/incarnation/heaven.md))
* The devil was given the name "Satan" (to identify him, but honours him as an important person).

# Changes made in favour of the Church
Some churches add a rule book, creeds or declarations that state that:
* [Church membership](/content/kingdom/church/history/7-sacraments.md) is necessary for [salvation](/content/kingdom/eternal/saved.md)
* [Submission under the church leadership](/content/kingdom/church/history/papal-authority.md) is necessary for [salvation](/content/kingdom/eternal/saved.md)
* Paying money to the church will release [financial blessings](/content/kingdom/life/wealth/tithing.md) or [eternal rewards](/content/kingdom/church/history/7-sacraments.md)
