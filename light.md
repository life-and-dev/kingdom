# What is Light?

I often hear Christians talk about "walking in the light" or "being the light of the world." But what does that actually mean? When Jesus calls us to be light, what is He asking us to do? If we should shine, what is [darkness](darkness.md)?

The confusion surrounding these metaphors leaves many of us unsure how to fulfill Christ's command to let our light shine.

## What is light in the Bible?

God created physical light on the first day:

> And God said, "Let there be light"
>
> **and there was light**.   
> And **God saw the light**, that it was good  
> and **God divided the light** from the darkness.   
> And **God called the light** Day, and the darkness he called Night.
>
> And the evening and the morning were **the first day**.
>
> — Genesis 1:3-5 (KJV)

However, Scripture also teaches that God **is** light in a metaphorical sense. This represents His truth, holiness, and revelation:

> This is the message we have heard from him and proclaim to you, that **God is light**, and in him is no darkness at all. — 1 John 1:5 (ESV)

These two truths complement each other: God created **physical light** as part of creation, yet God **is** light metaphorically. He is the source of all truth, revelation, and righteousness. Just as Jesus was sent as "the light of the world" to spread the good news of the Kingdom in a [world of darkness](darkness.md).

## What is the light?

Generally speaking light is considered information. Your eyes receive light (information about shapes, depth, movement, colours, body language, etc.) from your surroundings so that you can determine what is going on in your environment and act accordingly. 

### Revelation or Understanding

> The unfolding of **Your words gives light**; **it imparts understanding** to the simple. — Psalm 119:130 (ESV)

> Daniel answered and said:
>
> “Blessed be the name of God forever and ever, to whom belong wisdom and might.   
> He changes times and seasons;   
> He removes kings and sets up kings;   
> He gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to those who have understanding;  
> **He reveals deep and hidden things**;
> **He knows what is in the darkness**, and **the Light** dwells with Him.
>
> — Daniel 2:20-22 (ESV)

> There is a man in your kingdom in whom is the spirit of the holy gods. In the days of your father, **light and understanding and wisdom like the wisdom of the gods** were found in him, and King Nebuchadnezzar.
>
> ...
>
> I have heard of you that the spirit of the gods is in you, and that **light and understanding and excellent wisdom are found in you**.
>
> — Daniel 5:11,14 (ESV)

> And he came in the Spirit into the temple, and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him according to the custom of the Law, he took him up in his arms and blessed God and said,
>
> "Lord, now you are letting your servant depart in peace, according to your word; for my eyes have seen your salvation that you have prepared in the presence of all peoples, **a light for revelation to the Gentiles**, and for glory to your people Israel."
>
> — Luke 2:27-32 (ESV)

> We have also a more **sure word of prophecy**; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto **a light** that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts. Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation. For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. — 2 Peter 1:19-21 (KJV)

### Good works

Isaiah wrote:

> Woe to those who call evil good and good evil,  
> who put **darkness for light** and **light for darkness**,  
> who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter!  
> Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes, and shrewd in their own sight!  
> Woe to those who are heroes at drinking wine, and valiant men in mixing strong drink,  
> who acquit the guilty for a bribe, and deprive the innocent of his right!
>
> — Isaiah 5:20-23 (ESV)

Jesus said:

> "**You are the light** of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden. Nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see **your good works** and **give glory to your Father who is in heaven**." — Matthew 5:14-16 (ESV)

John wrote:

> At the same time, it is a new commandment that I am writing to you, which is true in him and in you, because the darkness is passing away and **the true light** is already shining.
>
> Whoever says he is in **the light** and **hates his brother is still in darkness**. Whoever loves his brother abides in **the light**, and in him there is **no cause for stumbling**. But **whoever hates his brother is in the darkness and walks in the darkness**, and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.
>
> — 1 John 2:8-11 (ESV)

Paul wrote:

> Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience. Therefore do not become partners with them; for at one time you were darkness, but now **you are light in the Lord**. Walk as **children of light** (for **the fruit of light is found in all that is good and right and true**), and try to discern what is pleasing to the Lord. Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead expose them. For it is shameful even to speak of the things that they do in secret. But **when anything is exposed by the light, it becomes visible**, for **anything that becomes visible is light**. — Ephesians 5:6-13 (ESV)

### Truth

> Send out **Your light** and **Your truth**; let them lead me. — Psalm 43:3 (ESV)

> **Do not be deceived**, my beloved brothers. Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from **the Father of lights** with **Whom there is no variation or shadow due to change**. Of His own will He brought us forth by **the word of truth**, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of His creatures. — James 1:16-18 (ESV)

> **For such men are false apostles, deceitful workmen, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ**. And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as **an angel of light**. So it is no surprise if his servants, also, **disguise** themselves as servants of righteousness. — 2 Corinthians 11:13-15 (ESV)

#### Fair justice

> **“Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD,  
> to the house of the God of Jacob,  
> that he may teach us his ways  
> and that we may walk in his paths.”**
>
> For out of Zion shall go the law,  
> and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.  
> **He shall judge between the nations,  
> and shall decide disputes for many peoples**;  
> and they shall beat their swords into plowshares,  
> and their spears into pruning hooks;  
> nation shall not lift up sword against nation,  
> neither shall they learn war anymore.
>
> O house of Jacob, come, let us **walk in the light of the LORD**.
>
> — Isaiah 2:3-5 (ESV)

> Give attention to Me, My people,
> and give ear to Me, My nation;
> for a law will go out from Me,
> and I will set **My justice for a light** to the peoples.
>
> — Isaiah 51:4 (ESV)

> Rejoice not over me, O my enemy;  
> when I fall, I shall rise;  
> when I sit in darkness,  
> **the LORD will be a light** to me.  
> I will bear the indignation of the LORD  
> because I have sinned against him,  
> until **He pleads my cause and executes judgment** for me.  
> He will **bring me out to the light**;
> **I shall look upon his vindication**.
>
> — Micah 7:8-9 (ESV)

> And **this is the judgment**: **the light has come into the world**, and people loved the darkness rather than the light because their works were evil. For **everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed**. But whoever does what is true **comes to the light**, so that it may be clearly seen that **his works** have been carried out in God." — John 3:19-21 (ESV)

> Jesus answered, "It was not that this man sinned, or his parents, but that **the works of God might be displayed in him. We must work the works of Him Who sent me while it is day**; night is coming, when **no one can work**. **As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.**" — John 9:3-5 (ESV)

> Therefore **do not pronounce judgment before the time**, before the Lord comes, **who will bring to light** the things now hidden in darkness and will disclose the purposes of the heart. — 1 Corinthians 4:5 (ESV)

### Righteousness

> And Jesus cried out and said, "**Whoever believes in me, believes not in me but in Him Who sent me.** And whoever sees me sees Him Who sent me. **I have come into the world as light**, so that **whoever believes in me may not remain in darkness**. If anyone hears my words and does not keep them, I do not judge him; for **I did not come to judge the world but to save the world**. — John 12:44-47 (ESV)

> Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers.
>
> For what partnership has **righteousness with lawlessness**?
> Or what fellowship has **light with darkness**?
>
> — 2 Corinthians 6:14 (ESV)

> May you be strengthened with all power, according to his glorious might, for all endurance and patience with joy, giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of the saints in **light**. He has delivered us from the domain of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved Son, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins. — Colossians 1:11-14 (ESV)

> But you are not in darkness, brothers, for that day to surprise you like a thief. For **you are all children of light, children of the day**. We are not of the night or of the darkness. So then let us not sleep, as others do, but let us keep awake and be sober. For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, are drunk at night. But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, having put on the breastplate of faith and love, and for a helmet the hope of salvation. — 1 Thessalonians 5:4-8 (ESV)

> Do all things without grumbling or disputing, that **you may be blameless and innocent children of God without blemish** in the midst of a crooked and twisted generation, among whom **you shine as lights in the world**, holding fast to the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I may be proud that I did not run in vain or labor in vain. — Philippians 2:14-16 (ESV)

> But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for His own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of **Him who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light**. **Once you were not a people, but now you are God's people**; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy. — 1 Peter 2:9-10 (ESV)

> This is the message we have heard from him and proclaim to you, that **God is light**, and in him is no darkness at all. **If we say we have fellowship with Him while we walk in darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth.** But if we **walk in the light, as He is in the light**, we have **fellowship with one another**, and the blood of Jesus His Son **cleanses us from all sin**. — 1 John 1:5-7 (ESV)

The Psalmists also associate light with righteousness.

> **Light** is sown for the righteous, and joy for the upright in heart. — Psalm 97:11 (ESV)

> **Light dawns in the darkness for the upright**; He is gracious, merciful, and righteous. — Psalm 112:4 (ESV)

> Save us, we pray, O LORD!  
> O LORD, we pray, give us success!  
> Blessed is he who comes in the name of the LORD!  
> We bless you from the house of the LORD.   
> The LORD is God, and He has made **His light to shine upon us**.
>
> — Psalm 118:25-27 (ESV)

### Salvation

> The LORD is **my light and my salvation**; whom shall I fear? — Psalm 27:1 (ESV)

> For with **You is the fountain of life**; in **Your light do we see light**. — Psalm 36:9 (ESV)

> For you have delivered my soul from death, yes, my feet from falling, that I may walk before God **in the light of life**. — Psalm 56:13 (ESV)

> “I am the LORD; I have called you in righteousness;  
> I will take you by the hand and keep you;  
> I will give you as **a covenant for the people**, **a light** for the nations,  
> to open the eyes that are blind,
> to bring out the prisoners from the dungeon,  
> from the prison those who sit in darkness."
>
> — Isaiah 42:6-7 (ESV)

> And the Lord said, ‘I am Jesus whom you are persecuting. But rise and stand upon your feet, for I have appeared to you for this purpose, to appoint you as a servant and witness to the things in which you have seen me and to those in which I will appear to you, delivering you from your people and from the Gentiles — to whom I am sending you to open their eyes, so that
> * they may **turn from darkness to light** and
> * from **the power of Satan to God**,
> * that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me.’
>
> ...
>
> To this day I have had the help that comes from God, and so I stand here testifying both to small and great, saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses said would come to pass:
>
> that the Christ must suffer and that, by being the first to rise from the dead, **he would proclaim light** both to our people and to the Gentiles.
>
> — Acts 26:15-18,22-23 (ESV)

> Besides this you know the time, that the hour has come for you to wake from sleep. For **salvation is nearer to us now** than when we first believed. The night is far gone; **the day** is at hand. So then let us cast off the works of darkness and **put on the armor of light**. Let us **walk properly as in the daytime, not in orgies and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and sensuality, not in quarreling and jealousy**. — Romans 13:11-13 (ESV)

### Guidance

> **Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light** to my path. — Psalm 119:105 (ESV)

> But **the path of the righteous is like the light of dawn**, which shines brighter and brighter until full day.
> The way of the wicked is like deep darkness; they do not know over what they stumble.
>
> — Proverbs 4:18-19 (ESV)

> And I will lead the blind in a way that they do not know, in paths that they have not known I will guide them.
>
> I will **turn the darkness before them into light**, the rough places into level ground.
>
> These are the things I do, and I do not forsake them.
>
> — Isaiah 42:16 (ESV)

> Then shall **your light** break forth like the dawn,  
> and your healing shall spring up speedily;  
> your righteousness shall go before you;  
> the glory of the LORD shall be your rear guard.  
> Then you shall call, and the LORD will answer;  
> you shall cry, and he will say, ‘Here I am.’  
> If you take away the yoke from your midst,  
> the pointing of the finger, and speaking wickedness,  
> if you pour yourself out for the hungry  
> and satisfy the desire of the afflicted,  
> then shall **your light rise in the darkness**  
> and **your gloom be as the noonday**.  
> And **the LORD will guide you continually**.
>
> — Isaiah 58:8-11 (ESV)

> Therefore justice is far from us,  
> and righteousness does not overtake us;  
> **we hope for light**, and behold, darkness,  
> and **for brightness**, but we walk in gloom.  
> We grope for the wall like the blind;  
> we grope like those who have no eyes;  
> we stumble at noon as in the twilight,  
> among those in full vigor we are like dead men.
>
> — Isaiah 59:9-10 (ESV)

> So Jesus said to them, "**The light is among you** for a little while longer. Walk while **you have the light**, lest darkness overtake you. **The one who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going.** While **you have the light**, **believe in the light**, that **you may become sons of light**." When Jesus had said these things, he departed and hid himself from them. — John 12:35-36 (ESV)

> If you are sure that you yourself are a guide to the blind, **a light to those who are in darkness, an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of children**, having in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth — you then who teach others, do you not teach yourself? — Romans 2:19-21 (ESV)

#### Teaching

> For **the commandment is a lamp** and **the teaching a light**, and the reproofs of discipline are the way of life. — Proverbs 6:23 (ESV)

> "No one after lighting a lamp puts it in a cellar or under a basket, but on a stand, so that those who enter may **see the light**. **Your eye is the lamp of your body**. When your eye is healthy, **your whole body is full of light**, but when it is bad, your body is full of darkness. Therefore be careful lest **the light in you** be darkness. If then **your whole body is full of light**, having no part dark, it will be wholly bright, as when **a lamp with its rays gives you light**." — Luke 11:33-36 (ESV); Matthew 6:22-23 (ESV); Mark 4:21-22 (ESV)

All three disciples wrote in the context of filling yourself with the correct teaching which leads to righteousness (serving the right God):

* Luke mentions the people of Nineveh that repented because of Jonah's preaching. (Luke 11:32 (ESV))
* Matthew mentions the focus on the right treasures (Matthew 6:21 (ESV)) and to serve the right master (Matthew 6:24 (ESV)).
* Mark mentions seed (teachings) that was sown and that needs to grow (Mark 4:20,23 (ESV)).

### Glory

God's glory is light:

> Arise, shine;  
> For **your light** has come!  
> And **[the glory](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/glory) of the LORD** *([YHVH](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/father/name#yhvh))* is risen upon you.  
> For behold, the darkness shall cover the earth,  
> And deep darkness the people;  
> But the LORD will arise over you,  
> And **[His glory](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/glory) will be seen upon you**.  
> The Gentiles shall come to **your light**,  
> And kings to **the brightness of your rising**.  
> “Lift up your eyes all around, and see:  
> They all gather together, they come to you;  
> Your sons shall come from afar,  
> And your daughters shall be nursed at your side.  
> Then **you shall see and become radiant**,  
> And your heart shall swell with joy;
>
> — Isaiah 60:1-5 (ESV)

and

> You have set our iniquities before you, our secret sins in **the light of your presence**. — Psalm 90:8 (ESV)

Therefore, David wrote:

> **The LORD is [my light](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/metaphors/light)** and my salvation... — Psalm 27:1 (ESV)

Because God glorifies Christ, Christ's glory is [the lamp of God's light](#what-is-a-lamp):

> And the city has no need of sun or moon to shine on it, for **[the glory](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/glory) of God gives it light**, and **[its lamp](#what-is-a-lamp) is the Lamb**. By **its light** will the nations walk, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it, and its gates will never be shut by day—and there will be no night there. — Revelation 21:23-25 (ESV)

## What is a lamp?

> For it is **You Who light my lamp; the LORD my God lightens my darkness**. — Psalm 18:28 (ESV)

The reason why God "lights our lamp" is so that we can be a light to others:

> **I will make you as a light** for the nations, that **My [salvation](https://eternal.family.net.za/eternal/saved)** may reach to the end of the earth. — Isaiah 49:6 (ESV)

This is also quoted by Paul:

> For so the Lord has commanded us, saying,
>
>> “ ‘**I have made you a light** for the Gentiles, that **you may bring [salvation](https://eternal.family.net.za/eternal/saved)** to the ends of the earth.’ ”
>
> And when the Gentiles heard this, they began rejoicing and glorifying [the word](https://son.ofgod.info/word) of the Lord, and as many as were appointed to [eternal life](https://eternal.family.net.za/eternal/new-earth) [believed](https://eternal.family.net.za/life/faith). And **[the word](https://son.ofgod.info/word) of the Lord was spreading** throughout the whole region.
>
> — Acts 13:47-49 (ESV)

When someone is "light" it means he is a lamp for God's light.

> If I *(Jesus)* alone bear witness about myself, my testimony is not true. There is **another** who bears witness about me, and I know that the testimony that he bears about me is true. **You sent to John, and he has borne witness to the truth**. Not that the testimony that I receive is from man, but I say these things so that you may be saved.  He *(John)* was a burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in **his light**. But the testimony that I have is greater than that of John. — John 5:31-36 (ESV)

This is why Jesus said:

> "**I am the light** of the world. **Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life**." — John 8:12 (ESV)

## How does one become a lamp?

One becomes a lamp by reflecting the image of God as Christ did:

> But even if our good news is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing, in whom the god of this age has blinded the minds of those who do not believe, to keep them from seeing and shining forth **the light of the good news of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God**.
>
> For we do not preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus' sake, because it is God Who said "**Light will shine out of darkness**", Who has shined in our hearts, to **provide illumination by way of the knowledge of the glory of God**, which is on the face of Jesus Christ.
>
> — 2 Corinthians 4:3-6 (REV)

Some Bible translations vastly differ from this quoted translation. However, I believe the message that Paul tried to communicate is that:

Everyone (including unbelievers whose "minds are blinded" by "the veil" of "the god of this age") has the ability to "shine forth" (spread) "the light of the good news of the glory of Christ" (Gospel) just as Christ reflects "the image of God".

In other words Christ taught, demonstrated and guided his disciples according to how [God's Holy Spirit](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/spirit) led him. Likewise we need to teach, demonstrate and guide our disciples according to how Christ leads us.

This interpretation aligns with the broader biblical teaching about believers as witnesses and light-bearers:

Paul's message of 2 Corinthians 4:5-6 could be analyzed this way:

1. "For we do not [preach](#revelation-or-understanding) ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord" (Philippians 2:11 (ESV)).
2. "[We are] [your servants](#good-works) for Jesus' sake" (Matthew 20:28 (ESV); Galatians 5:13 (ESV)).
3. God said "Light will shine out of darkness" - We used to be the darkness or deceived, but when we spread the Gospel we shine forth light or [truth](#truth) (Ephesians 5:8 (ESV); Colossians 1:13 (ESV))
4. "[God] shined in our hearts" by [His presence](#glory) when we live [righteously](#righteousness) (Psalm 97:11 (ESV); Proverbs 4:18 (ESV))
5. By turning "darkness" into "light", God is effectively [giving eternal life](#salvation) to those who would have "perished" (Acts 26:18 (ESV)).
6. When we "shine" we "provide illumination" ([guidance](#guidance)) to "[the knowledge](#teaching) of the glory of God" (Colossians 1:28 (ESV); 2 Timothy 2:2 (ESV))
7. We spread the Gospel by "the face of Jesus Christ" - [live like Jesus Christ did](#good-works) (1 John 2:6 (ESV); 1 Peter 2:21 (ESV)).

> **The light** of the righteous rejoices, but **the lamp** of the wicked will be put out. — Proverbs 13:9 (ESV)

Therefore, we shine our light by:

1. [Revealing](#revelation-or-understanding) that "Christ Jesus is Lord".
2. Serving the lost with [good works](#good-works), like Jesus did.
3. Revealing [the truth](#truth) for [fair justice](#fair-justice), like Jesus did.
4. Living [righteous](#righteousness) in [God's presence](#glory), like Jesus did.
5. Making sacrifices for God's kingdom so others could receive [eternal salvation](#salvation), like Jesus did.
6. [Guiding](#guidance) others to "the knowledge of [the glory of God](#glory)", like Jesus did.
7. [Glorifying God](#glory), like Jesus Christ did.

Jesus said:

> "No one after lighting a lamp covers it with a jar or puts it under a bed, but puts it on a stand, so that those who enter may **see the light**. For nothing is hidden that will not be made manifest, nor is anything secret that will not be known and **come to light**. — Luke 8:16-17 (ESV)

## What Will You Do with Your Lamp?

You now understand what light truly means: revelation, truth, righteousness, good works, salvation, guidance, and God's glory. You also know that you become a lamp when you reflect Christ's image by serving others, speaking truth, living righteously, and glorifying God.

But knowledge alone does not make you a light. A lamp that sits in the closet provides no illumination. The question is not whether you **have** light, but whether you are **letting it shine**.

Look at your life today. Are you hiding your lamp under a basket? Are you calling evil good and good evil? Are you walking in darkness while claiming to abide in the light? Or are you actively reflecting Christ's image through sacrificial service, bold truth-telling, and righteous living?

God has lit your lamp. The choice to put it on a stand is yours. **What will you do with the light you have been given?**
