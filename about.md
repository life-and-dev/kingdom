# About the author

My journey with faith has been anything but conventional. From atheism to exploring various Christian traditions including megachurches to house churches with involvement in various traditional protestants, charismatic and messianic congregations. I've spent years asking questions about God, the Bible, and what it truly means to follow Christ.

## A Shared Journey of Discovery

Throughout this journey, I've become increasingly fascinated by what the Bible teaches about the Kingdom of God. What is it? Where is it? How do we participate in it? 

These questions have led me deep into studying the prophecies of God, teachings of Jesus and the witnesses of the early church. Through this exploration, I've come to understand that the Kingdom of God is broader and more profound than institutional [church](https://church.ofgod.info) structures.

This website is the fruit of that ongoing exploration. I'm still learning, still discovering new depths in familiar passages, and still amazed by how much there is to understand about [our Father God](https://ofgod.info) and His [son](https://son.ofgod.info) Jesus who is the Christ and our Lord.

### The Heart Behind This Website

I want to help fellow believers have more faith in God and understand what it means to follow Jesus. This website proclaims **what the Bible teaches about [the Kingdom of God](https://kingdom.ofgod.info) as revealed through Jesus**' ministry and teachings.

Many Christians understand "the Kingdom" and "the Church" to be the same thing, and I respect that perspective. However, this website explores what I believe is a biblical distinction between them—the Kingdom of God is the reign and rule of God that encompasses all who submit to His authority, while the church represents organized gatherings of believers. I present this view with humility and invite you to discover these truths alongside me.

You'll find here careful attention to [biblical texts](https://word.ofgod.info), exploration of themes that intrigue me, and honest wrestling with questions that many of us have wondered about. Some topics might be unfamiliar. Some interpretations might differ from what you've heard before. That's okay — in fact, that's part of the journey.

### Full Transparency

I write independently, not affiliated with any church or organization, and without sponsorship. This freedom allows me to follow where God's word leads without institutional constraints.

I encourage you to critically evaluate everything you read. Not just on this website, but always pray about any Christian content from any source you receive. I admit that I have been [wrong before](disclaimer.md), and I'll likely make more mistakes. That's why I genuinely invite you to [correct my errors](edit.md) when you spot them. Your wisdom, your insights, and your questions make this a richer resource for everyone who visits.

### An Invitation to Explore

Rather than asking you to accept my conclusions, I invite you to examine the Bible for yourself. The content here is designed to point you back to God's word, to raise questions worth pondering, and to provide tools for your own study.

As you explore this site, I encourage you to:
- Test everything against the Scripture (Acts 17:11)
- Ask the Holy Spirit for wisdom and discernment
- Engage thoughtfully with ideas that might be new to you
- Share what you discover with others

Whether you read one article or explore the entire site, my prayer is that it draws you closer to God's love and your position in His eternal Kingdom.

Join me in this journey of discovery, exploring together what it means to be a citizen of the Kingdom of God.
