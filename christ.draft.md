# The Christ

## Who is Jesus?

- To Christians, he is the Christ, [the Son of God](https://son.ofgod.info), the savior of the world
- To Muslims, he is a revered prophet, born of a virgin, but not God's Son
- To Jews, he was a teacher who didn't fulfill messianic prophecies
- To secularists, he was perhaps a wise moral teacher, but nothing more

If Jesus is who he claimed to be, it changes everything. How we understand God, ourselves, history, and our eternal destiny.

## Prophecies Fulfilled

For centuries before Jesus' birth, Hebrew prophets wrote specific predictions about a coming Messiah. These weren't vague generalities but detailed descriptions:

- **Genealogy**: Descended from Abraham, through Judah's tribe, from David's royal line (Genesis 12:3, 49:10, 2 Samuel 7:12-13)
- **Birth**: In Bethlehem, to a virgin, during specific historical window (Micah 5:2, Isaiah 7:14, Daniel 9:24-26)
- **Ministry**: Teaching with authority, healing the sick, gentle yet powerful (Isaiah 61:1-2, 35:5-6, 42:1-4)
- **Ruling & Reigning**: Establishing eternal Kingdom and government (Isaiah 9:6-7, Daniel 7:13-14, Psalm 2:6-8, Zechariah 9:9)
- **Suffering**: Betrayed for thirty pieces of silver, buried in a rich man's tomb (Zechariah 11:12, Isaiah 53:9,12)
- **Resurrection**: Raised from the dead before his body saw decay (Psalm 16:10, Isaiah 53:10-11)
- **Exaltation**: Seated at God's right hand with all authority (Psalm 110:1, Daniel 7:13-14)

Jesus fulfilled them all.

### What the Prophets Emphasized

When we compare messianic prophecies, a pattern emerges:

#### SUFFERING/DYING Prophecies:
1. Psalm 16:10 - "You will not abandon my soul to Sheol" (resurrection prophecy)
2. Isaiah 50:6 - "I gave my back to those who strike, my cheeks to those who pull out the beard"
3. Isaiah 53:3-12: "Pierced for our transgressions... crushed for our iniquities"
4. Daniel 9:26 - "Shall be cut off and have nothing"
5. Zechariah 12:10: "Him whom they have pierced"

However, most of these suffering/dying prophecies are disputed by Jewish interpreters. For example:
- Psalm 16 - Jews see this as David speaking about himself, not a messianic prophecy
- Isaiah 50 and Isaiah 53 - Traditionally understood as referring to the nation of Israel, not an individual Messiah (though some ancient Jewish sources did apply suffering servant passages to the Messiah)
- Daniel 9:26 - Jews dispute that 'anointed one' refers to THE Messiah; it could be any anointed person (priest/king)
- Zechariah 12:10 - Refers to a historical figure, not necessarily the Messiah"

#### RULING/REIGNING Prophecies
In general most Jews and Christians view these prophecies as messianic:

1. Genesis 49:10 - "The scepter shall not depart from Judah... until tribute comes to him"
2. Numbers 24:17 - "A star shall come out of Jacob, and a scepter shall rise out of Israel"
3. Isaiah 11:1-10: "He shall judge the poor... righteousness shall be his belt"
4. Jeremiah 23:5: "He shall REIGN as king and deal wisely"
5. Micah 5:2: "One who is to be RULER in Israel"
6. Zechariah 9:9: "Your KING is coming to you"

Christians but only some Jewish groups view these passages as messianic:

7. 2 Samuel 7:12-13: "I will establish the throne of his KINGDOM forever"
8. Psalm 2:6-8: "I have set my KING on Zion... I will make the nations your heritage"
9. Psalm 110:1-4 - "The LORD says to my Lord: 'Sit at my right hand'
10. Isaiah 9:6-7: "Of the increase of his GOVERNMENT... no end... over his KINGDOM"
11. Daniel 7:13-14: "To him was given dominion and glory and a KINGDOM... everlasting dominion"

Christians reject Psalms of Solomon 17 which describes the Messiah as a conquering warrior-king.

In general, the Jewish people expected the Messiah primarily to **rule**, not to suffer and die.

## Why Did Jesus Come?

### Jesus' First Message

The very first words of Jesus' public ministry reveal his primary purpose:

> "From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, 'Repent, for **the kingdom of heaven is at hand**.'" (Matthew 4:17)

> "The time is fulfilled, and **the kingdom of God is at hand**; repent and believe in the gospel." (Mark 1:15)

### Jesus' Primary Teaching

Throughout his ministry, Jesus' message centered on the Kingdom:

- **Sermon on the Mount** (Matthew 5-7): Kingdom ethics—how Kingdom citizens live
- **The Lord's Prayer** (Matthew 6:9-13): "**Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth** as it is in heaven"
- **Parables** (Matthew 13): Seven parables, ALL beginning "the kingdom of heaven is like..." including more throughout the Gospels (Matthew 18, Matthew 20, Matthew 22, Matthew 25; Luke 13, Luke 14, Luke 15, and so forth)
- **Post-Resurrection** (Acts 1:3): For 40 days after rising, Jesus appeared to his disciples "**speaking about the kingdom of God**"

Even after dying and rising, Jesus emphasized **the Kingdom of God**, not atonement theology.

### A Common Misconception

Many Christians focus primarily on "The Cross", a shorter term for cruxificion which refers to Jesus' suffering and death. 

However, Jesus's message was not *"I came to die for your sins"* but instead Jesus taught ***"the kingdom of God is at hand."***

While the crucifixion was necessary, it was not the ONLY purpose. If Jesus' ONLY purpose was to die as a sacrifice, 

**Why didn't God allow King Herod to kill him as a baby if his blood would accomplish the same sacrificial purpose?**

Instead God intervened by provision (gifts from the Wise Men - Matthew 2:11) to fund the journey, and by supernaturally warning Joseph in a dream to flee to Egypt (Matthew 2:13-15), protecting Jesus until Herod's death (Matthew 2:19-20).

Some would argue that Jesus' secondary objective was to preach the Gospel. However, the gospel message could have come through John the Baptist or the other disciples or even another prophet. Why risk contamination with sin during Jesus' temptations in the wilderness (Matthew 4:1-11) if his only purpose was to die?

**Because establishing the Kingdom required a king who would live, teach, demonstrate his authority in the Kingdom of God.**

Jesus' mission was multi-faceted, not single-purpose:

1. **Establish the Kingdom of God** (Luke 4:43; Mark 1:38; John 18:36-37)
2. Reveal [God the Father](https://ofgod.info)'s character (John 14:9)
3. Demonstrate Kingdom power (healings, demonic deliverances, natural miracles, etc.)
4. Train disciples to continue Kingdom work (Matthew 28:19-20)
5. Provide covenant blood enabling Kingdom entry (Matthew 26:28)
6. Warn people about future judgement with prophecies of God (Matthew 25:31-46; John 5:22,27-29)

### What Is the Kingdom of God?

To understand why Jesus came, we must understand what the "Kingdom of God" means.

#### What Adam Had (The Original Kingdom)

In the beginning, God created humanity with a specific purpose:

> "Then God said, 'Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. And **let them have dominion** over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.'" (Genesis 1:26)

> "And God said to them, 'Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and **subdue it and have dominion**...'" (Genesis 1:28)

Adam and Eve enjoyed:
- **God's presence** (walking with God in the garden - Genesis 3:8)
- **God's rule** (humans obeying naturally, doing God's will)
- **Dominion over creation** (authority to rule under God)
- **Peace, life, harmony, purpose**

This was the Kingdom of God: Humans willingly ruling creation under God's authority, His presence with His people.

#### What Adam Lost

> "Therefore the LORD God sent him out from the garden of Eden... He drove out the man." (Genesis 3:23-24)

Through disobedience, Adam forfeited:
- **God's presence** (expelled from the garden)
- **Relationship with God** (broken, hiding in fear)
- **Dominion over creation** (ground cursed, authority lost)
- **Life** (death entered - Romans 5:12)

Adam was supposed to be the lord of God's Kingdom on earth, ruling creation under God's authority. He failed the test.

#### What Jesus Came to Restore

> "The kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking but **righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit**." (Romans 14:17)

> "The kingdom of God is not coming in ways that can be observed, nor will they say, 'Look, here it is!' or 'There!' for behold, **the kingdom of God is in the midst of you**." (Luke 17:20-21)

> "He has delivered us from the domain of darkness and **transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved Son**." (Colossians 1:13)

The Kingdom of God is God's rule/reign restored in human hearts, His presence with His people. Jesus came to restore what Adam lost.

### Why Did God Wait Thousands of Years?

If the Kingdom was God's plan, why wait approximately 4000 years from Adam to Jesus?

**Because all human systems had to fail first.**

From Adam to Christ, humanity tried every conceivable form of governance:

1. **Family/Tribal Governance (Adam to Noah)**: Humans living by their own wisdom
   - Result: "The LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great... every intention... was only evil continually" (Genesis 6:5)
   - Conclusion: **Failed**

2. **Law (Moses)**: God's perfect law given to guide behavior
   - Result: Golden calf immediately (Exodus 32), constant rebellion
   - Paul's conclusion: "For God has done what **the law, weakened by the flesh, could not do**" (Romans 8:3)
   - Conclusion: **Failed** (law reveals sin but cannot save)

3. **Judges**: God raised up deliverers to lead Israel
   - Result: "Everyone did what was right in his own eyes" (Judges 21:25)
   - Constant cycles of sin, oppression, deliverance, sin again
   - Conclusion: **Failed**

4. **Kings**: Human monarchs ruling God's people
   - Result: Kingdom divided, idolatry, exile
   - Even the best kings (David, Solomon) committed serious sins
   - Conclusion: **Failed**

5. **Empires** (Babylon, Persia, Greece, Rome): World powers governing nations
   - Result: All rose and fell, all oppressive, all temporary
   - Daniel's vision (Daniel 2): God's Kingdom will crush human empires
   - Conclusion: **Failed**

By the time Jesus arrived, **every human system had been exhausted**. Humanity had proven utterly incapable of self-governance. The 4000-year test demonstrated humanity's absolute need for God's Kingdom, ruled by a worthy human King.

> "But when the **fullness of time** had come, God sent forth his Son, born of woman, born under the law." (Galatians 4:4)

The "fullness of time" = when the test was complete, when no one could say "but we haven't tried this yet."

## Why Jesus Had to Be Human

### The Last Adam / Second Adam

Paul called Jesus the "Last Adam" or "Second Adam" in Scripture:

> "For as by a man came death, by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive." (1 Corinthians 15:21-22)

> "Thus it is written, 'The first man Adam became a living being'; **the last Adam** became a life-giving spirit. The first man was from the earth, a man of dust; the second man is from heaven." (1 Corinthians 15:45,47)

> "For as by the one man's disobedience the many were made sinners, so **by the one man's obedience** the many will be made righteous." (Romans 5:19)

Notice the repeated emphasis: "by a **man**" ... "one **man's** obedience."

**Why does this matter?**

### What Adam Failed, Jesus Succeeded

**Adam:**
- Given dominion over creation (Genesis 1:26-28)
- Placed in God's presence (Genesis 2:8,15)
- Given a test (tree of knowledge - Genesis 2:16-17)
- **Failed the test** through disobedience (Genesis 3:6)
- Forfeited human right to rule (Genesis 3:23-24)

**Jesus:**
- Born as fully human (1 Timothy 2:5)
- Faced temptation just like Adam (Matthew 4:1-11)
- **Passed the test** through obedience (Philippians 2:8)
- Reclaimed human right to rule (Acts 2:36, Matthew 28:18)

**Here's the profound point:** If Jesus was God, nothing is proven. God cannot fail, cannot be tempted (James 1:13), cannot disobey Himself. A divine being resisting temptation tells us nothing about human potential.

But if Jesus was fully **HUMAN** (empowered by the Holy Spirit, just as we can be), then everything is proven:
- Humans CAN obey God by His Spirit
- Humans CAN resist temptation by His power
- Humans CAN fulfill their original purpose
- Humans CAN be restored to dominion under God

> "God anointed Jesus of Nazareth **with the Holy Spirit and with power**. He went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him." (Acts 10:38)

Jesus operated by the Holy Spirit, not inherent divinity. This makes his obedience meaningful and his example achievable.

### The Mediator Must Be Human

> "For there is one God, and there is **one mediator** between God and men, **the MAN Christ Jesus**." (1 Timothy 2:5)

Not "the God Christ Jesus" but "the **MAN** Christ Jesus."

Why must the mediator be human?

**1. Humans Cannot Interact with Unveiled God:**

When God appeared at Mount Sinai, the people were terrified:

> "Now when all the people saw the thunder and the flashes of lightning and the sound of the trumpet and the mountain smoking, the people were afraid and trembled, and they stood far off and said to Moses, **'You speak to us, and we will listen; but do not let God speak to us, lest we die.'**" (Exodus 20:18-19)

> "But," he said, "you cannot see my face, for **man shall not see me and live**." (Exodus 33:20)

> "No one has ever seen God." (John 1:18)

Humans need a mediator—someone who can represent them to God and God to them.

**2. To Restore Humanity to Original Purpose:**

God's original design was for humans to have dominion over creation (Genesis 1:26-28). Adam forfeited this right. If God simply ruled directly, the original design would be abandoned.

Jesus, as HUMAN, reclaims the human right to rule. He fulfills what Adam failed to accomplish:

> "What is man that you are mindful of him, and the son of man that you care for him? Yet you have made him a little lower than the heavenly beings and **crowned him with glory and honor**. You have given him **dominion over the works of your hands**; you have put **all things under his feet**." (Psalm 8:4-6)

This psalm describes humanity's original calling. The New Testament applies it specifically to Jesus—the human who fulfilled what humanity was meant to be.

**3. To Set an Achievable Example:**

> "For we do not have a high priest who is unable to **sympathize with our weaknesses**, but one who in every respect **has been tempted as we are**, yet without sin." (Hebrews 4:15)

If Jesus was God, his example is meaningless to us. We cannot be God. But if Jesus was human empowered by the Holy Spirit (the same Spirit available to us - Acts 2:38), then his example is achievable.

### A Note on Jesus' Nature

The question of Jesus' exact nature (fully human vs. God incarnate vs. both) has been debated for centuries. While this article emphasizes Jesus' humanity—which Scripture clearly and repeatedly affirms (1 Timothy 2:5, 1 Corinthians 15:21-22,45, Romans 5:19, Hebrews 4:15)—we recognize that sincere believers hold different views.

What matters most is recognizing that Jesus' humanity is **essential**, not incidental. Without genuine humanity, Jesus cannot be the "Last Adam," cannot truly be tempted, cannot reclaim human dominion, and cannot set an example we can follow.

## How Do You Enter the Kingdom?

Jesus came to establish the Kingdom of God. How does someone enter this Kingdom?

Scripture presents a clear process with four interconnected steps:

### 1. The New Covenant - Creating the Possibility

On the night before his death, Jesus took the cup and said:

> "Drink of it, all of you, for this is **my blood of the covenant**, which is poured out for many **for the forgiveness of sins**." (Matthew 26:28)

> "This cup that is poured out for you is **the new covenant in my blood**." (Luke 22:20)

Centuries earlier, God had promised through the prophet Jeremiah:

> "Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will make **a new covenant** with the house of Israel and the house of Judah, not like the covenant that I made with their fathers on the day when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt...
>
> For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares the LORD: **I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts**. And I will be their God, and they shall be my people. And no longer shall each one teach his neighbor and each his brother, saying, 'Know the LORD,' for **they shall all know me**, from the least of them to the greatest, declares the LORD. For **I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more**." (Jeremiah 31:31-34)

The New Covenant promises:
- **Internal transformation** (law written on hearts, not stone tablets)
- **Direct relationship with God** (all shall know Him personally)
- **Complete forgiveness** (sins remembered no more)
- **New heart and God's Spirit within** (Ezekiel 36:26-27)

Jesus' blood establishes this covenant, creating the **framework** for Kingdom entry. The covenant is the door; we must walk through it.

### 2. Adoption - Acceptance into the Kingdom

Once the covenant exists, we must enter it:

> "But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, **he gave the right to become children of God**." (John 1:12)

> "For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received **the Spirit of adoption as sons**, by whom we cry, 'Abba! Father!'" (Romans 8:15)

> "And because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, 'Abba! Father!'" (Galatians 4:6)

Through faith in Jesus, you are **adopted** into God's family. You become a Kingdom citizen, a child of the King. This is your legal status—you belong to God's household.

### 3. Forgiveness - Removal of the Barrier

As a newly adopted child, the barrier of sin must be addressed:

> "In him we have **redemption through his blood**, the **forgiveness of our trespasses**, according to the riches of his grace." (Ephesians 1:7)

> "But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and **the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin**." (1 John 1:7)

> "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness." (1 John 1:9)

**An Important Distinction:**

Forgiveness removes the **DEBT** of sin (the penalty, the guilt), but not sin **itself**—at least not yet. This happens in three stages:

**a) Justification** - Freed from sin's **PENALTY** (past tense, completed)
> "There is therefore now **no condemnation** for those who are in Christ Jesus." (Romans 8:1)
>
> "Therefore, since we have been **justified by faith**, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ." (Romans 5:1)

The debt is paid. You will not be judged for your sins. This is a completed legal transaction.

**b) Sanctification** - Being freed from sin's **POWER** (present tense, ongoing)
> "For **sin will have no dominion over you**, since you are not under law but under grace." (Romans 6:14)
>
> "For the law of the Spirit of life has **set you free** in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and death." (Romans 8:2)

However:
> "If we say we have **no sin**, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us." (1 John 1:8)

We still sin, but sin no longer **dominates** us. We have the power to resist through the Holy Spirit. This is a progressive transformation.

**c) Glorification** - Freed from sin's **PRESENCE** (future tense, not yet)
> "What is sown is perishable; what is raised is imperishable... It is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power." (1 Corinthians 15:42-43)
>
> "He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away." (Revelation 21:4)

When Jesus returns and we receive our resurrection bodies, sin will be completely removed. Until then, we are in the sanctification process.

### 4. Peace - Reconciliation Complete

With the debt removed and the relationship restored:

> "Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have **peace with God** through our Lord Jesus Christ." (Romans 5:1)

> "For he himself is **our peace**, who has made us both one and has broken down in his flesh the dividing wall of hostility." (Ephesians 2:14)

> "All this is from God, who through Christ **reconciled us to himself**... that is, in Christ God was **reconciling the world to himself**, not counting their trespasses against them." (2 Corinthians 5:18-19)

**Peace** (*shalom* in Hebrew) means more than absence of conflict. It means:
- Wholeness
- Harmony with God
- Restored relationship
- Everything in right order

You are now at peace with God, living in the Kingdom, empowered by His Spirit.

### Summary: The Four Steps

1. **New Covenant** → The possibility of Kingdom entry (Jesus' blood establishes the covenant)
2. **Adoption** → Acceptance into the Kingdom (you become God's child)
3. **Forgiveness** → Removal of the barrier (debt paid, cleansing begins)
4. **Peace** → Reconciliation complete (harmony restored)

This is not earning salvation through works—it's receiving a gift through faith. But receiving requires action: believing, repenting, committing to Jesus as King.

## How Does Jesus Reign Now?

Jesus is the King, crowned with all authority:

> "And Jesus came and said to them, '**All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me**.'" (Matthew 28:18)

> "Being therefore exalted at the right hand of God... **God has made him both Lord and Christ**, this Jesus whom you crucified." (Acts 2:33,36)

But there's an obvious challenge: **Jesus physically left earth**. He ascended to heaven (Acts 1:9-11) and has not yet returned. So how does he reign now? How does the Kingdom advance without the King's physical presence?

### Through the Holy Spirit

Before leaving, Jesus made a remarkable promise:

> "Nevertheless, I tell you the truth: **it is to your advantage that I go away**, for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you. But if I go, I will send him to you." (John 16:7)

Why would Jesus' departure be to our advantage?

> "When the Spirit of truth comes, **he will guide you into all the truth**, for he will not speak on his own authority, but whatever he hears he will speak, and he will declare to you the things that are to come. **He will glorify me**, for he will take what is mine and declare it to you." (John 16:13-14)

After ascending to heaven, Jesus sent the Holy Spirit:

> "Being therefore exalted at the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, **he has poured out this** that you yourselves are seeing and hearing." (Acts 2:33)

**The Holy Spirit is the means by which Jesus continues to work:**
- The Spirit **guides** believers into truth (John 16:13)
- The Spirit **empowers** believers for ministry (Acts 1:8)
- The Spirit **produces fruit** in believers' lives (Galatians 5:22-23)
- The Spirit **gifts** believers for service (1 Corinthians 12:7-11)
- The Spirit **convicts** the world of sin (John 16:8-11)

When Jesus was physically present, he could only be in one place at a time. But through the Holy Spirit, Jesus can be present with every believer simultaneously.

### Through Believers (The Body of Christ)

Jesus not only sent the Holy Spirit—he also commissioned his followers:

> "Truly, truly, I say to you, **whoever believes in me will also do the works that I do; and greater works than these will he do**, because I am going to the Father." (John 14:12)

The book of Acts doesn't begin by saying, "This is what the apostles did after Jesus left." It says:

> "In the first book, O Theophilus, I have dealt with all that Jesus **BEGAN to do and teach**." (Acts 1:1)

The implication? Acts records what Jesus **CONTINUED** to do—through his disciples.

**Believers Are Christ's Body:**

> "Now **YOU are the body of Christ** and individually members of it." (1 Corinthians 12:27)

> "And he put all things under his feet and gave him as **head over all things to the church, which is his body**, the fullness of him who fills all in all." (Ephesians 1:22-23)

Think of it this way:
- **Head** (Jesus) → Directs, commands, controls
- **Body** (Believers) → Executes, acts, makes visible

Jesus is the Head in heaven, giving direction through the Holy Spirit. Believers are the Body on earth, carrying out his direction. The Body makes the Head's will visible and tangible.

**What Works Did Jesus Do That We Continue?**

When Jesus began his ministry, he declared:

> "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to **proclaim good news to the poor**. He has sent me to **proclaim liberty to the captives** and **recovering of sight to the blind**, to **set at liberty those who are oppressed**, to **proclaim the year of the Lord's favor**." (Luke 4:18-19)

Throughout his ministry, Jesus:
- **Taught** about the Kingdom (Matthew 4:23)
- **Proclaimed** the good news (Mark 1:14)
- **Healed** the sick (Luke 4:40)
- **Delivered** people from demons (Matthew 12:28)
- **Met needs** (John 6:5-13, feeding 5000)
- **Demonstrated** Kingdom values (love, compassion, justice)

Believers continue these exact works:
- **Teaching**: "Go therefore and make disciples... **teaching them** to observe all that I have commanded you" (Matthew 28:19-20)
- **Proclaiming**: "But when they believed Philip as he preached good news about **the kingdom of God**" (Acts 8:12)
- **Healing**: Peter healed a lame man (Acts 3:6-7), "they were all healed" (Acts 5:16)
- **Delivering**: Paul cast out a demon (Acts 16:18)
- **Meeting needs**: "There was not a needy person among them" (Acts 4:34)
- **Demonstrating Kingdom values**: "See how they love one another!" (early church reputation)

The Kingdom advances through believers doing the works Jesus began.

### A Note on the Church

The early believers didn't gather in special buildings with professional clergy. They met organically:

> "Aquila and Prisca... greet you, together with **the church in their house**." (1 Corinthians 16:19)

> "Greet Prisca and Aquila... also **the church in their house**." (Romans 16:3,5)

> "And day by day, attending the temple together and **breaking bread in their homes**, they received their food with glad and generous hearts." (Acts 2:46)

In their gatherings, everyone participated:

> "When you come together, **each one has** a hymn, a lesson, a revelation, a tongue, or an interpretation. Let all things be done for building up." (1 Corinthians 14:26)

The "Body of Christ" is this **organic, Spirit-led community** of believers functioning together—not institutional structures or religious systems. The Kingdom of God operates through transformed people living out Kingdom values, not through buildings or denominations.

### Summary: How Jesus Reigns

Jesus reigns through:
1. **The Holy Spirit** dwelling in and empowering believers
2. **Believers** (the Body) continuing the works Jesus began
3. **Organic community** (not institutional religion)
4. **Spiritual authority** (not political or military power)

> "Jesus answered, '**My kingdom is not of this world**. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would have been fighting, that I might not be delivered over to the Jews. But my kingdom is not from the world.'" (John 18:36)

The Kingdom advances through changed hearts and transformed lives, not through worldly power structures.

## Contemporary Evidence

Jesus isn't merely a historical figure studied in dusty books. People today encounter him—and evidence continues mounting.

### Lee Strobel's Investigation

Award-winning journalist Lee Strobel, an atheist with a Yale Law degree, set out to disprove Christianity when his wife converted. His investigative research led to an unexpected conclusion.

Over two years (1980-1982), Strobel interviewed leading scholars:
- **Eyewitness testimony**: Gospels written within one generation
- **Documentary evidence**: 5,800+ Greek manuscripts, 99.5% textually accurate
- **Corroborating sources**: 10+ non-Christian historians confirm Jesus' existence, crucifixion, and resurrection claims
- **Scientific evidence**: Medical analysis confirms Jesus truly died; resurrection best explains evidence

Strobel's conclusion: "I had seen enough. The evidence was absolutely convincing."

### Archaeological Discoveries

- Pool of Bethesda discovered (John 5:2)
- Pool of Siloam found (John 9:7)
- Pontius Pilate inscription (1961)
- Caiaphas ossuary (1990)
- Crucifixion victim with nail through heel—confirms Gospel descriptions

### Non-Christian Historical Sources

Enemy attestation from hostile witnesses:
- **Josephus** (Jewish historian): Jesus, crucified under Pilate, resurrection claims
- **Tacitus** (Roman historian): Christ executed by Pontius Pilate
- **Pliny the Younger** (Roman governor): Christians worship Christ as God
- **Babylonian Talmud**: Jesus hanged on Passover, practiced "sorcery"

### Modern Testimonies

Across cultures and backgrounds, people report encountering Jesus:
- Scholarly conversions (philosophers, scientists)
- Muslim visions and dreams (documented phenomenon)
- Miraculous healings with medical documentation
- Near-death experiences consistently mentioning Jesus

*The evidence keeps growing. History supports the Gospels. Lives continue transforming.*

## Why Follow Jesus?

Evidence leads somewhere. If Jesus is who he claimed, the response isn't mere intellectual agreement but personal commitment.

### Because He Is the King

> "And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. Therefore **God has highly exalted him** and bestowed on him the name that is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that **Jesus Christ is Lord**, to the glory of God the Father." (Philippians 2:8-11)

> "Let all the house of Israel therefore know for certain that **God has made him both Lord and Christ**, this Jesus whom you crucified." (Acts 2:36)

Jesus is not merely a good teacher or moral example. He is the appointed King, crowned by God with all authority.

### Because the Kingdom Is Real

> "He has delivered us from the domain of darkness and **transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved Son**, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins." (Colossians 1:13-14)

The Kingdom isn't just a future hope—it's a present reality. Believers are already citizens of this Kingdom, already living under Jesus' reign.

### Because of What He Promises

**Kingdom Citizenship:**
> "But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave **the right to become children of God**." (John 1:12)

**Abundant Life:**
> "I came that they may have **life and have it abundantly**." (John 10:10)

**Forgiveness:**
> "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to **forgive us our sins** and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness." (1 John 1:9)

**Eternal Life:**
> "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have **eternal life**." (John 3:16)

**Holy Spirit's Power:**
> "But you will receive **power** when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses." (Acts 1:8)

**His Presence:**
> "And behold, **I am with you always**, to the end of the age." (Matthew 28:20)

### What Following Looks Like

- **Not religion but relationship** (John 17:3)
- **Not earning salvation but receiving a gift** (Ephesians 2:8-9)
- **Not duty but love response** (1 John 4:19)
- **Not self-effort but Spirit empowerment** (Galatians 5:22-23)

### How to Enter the Kingdom

Following the four-step process we explored earlier:

1. **Recognize your separation from God** - "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God" (Romans 3:23)

2. **Believe in Jesus as King** - "If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved" (Romans 10:9)

3. **Repent** - Turn from sin toward God - "Repent therefore, and turn back, that your sins may be blotted out" (Acts 3:19)

4. **Receive Jesus and the Kingdom** - "But to all who did receive him... he gave the right to become children of God" (John 1:12)

The invitation stands:

> "Come to Me, all who are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls." (Matthew 11:28-29)

## Next Steps

Jesus himself asked his disciples:

> "Who do you say that I am?" (Matthew 16:15)

The question remains. Who is Jesus to YOU?

**1. Ask God to reveal truth**
> "If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him." (James 1:5)

- Identify your specific objections—don't generalize
- Research answers with intellectual honesty
- Consider: What evidence would convince you?

**2. Be willing to follow evidence wherever it leads**

The Bereans were commended because "they received the word with all eagerness, **examining the Scriptures daily** to see if these things were so." (Acts 17:11)

**3. Connect with Kingdom community**

The Kingdom is lived in community, not in isolation. Seek out believers who are genuinely following Jesus and living out Kingdom values—not merely attending religious services.

> "Ask, and it will be given to you.
> Seek, and you will find.
> Knock, and it will be opened to you.
> For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened." (Matthew 7:7-8)

The King is calling. The Kingdom awaits. How will you respond?
