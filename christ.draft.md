# The Christ

Throughout history, one question has divided humanity more than any other: **Who is Jesus of Nazareth?**

- To Christians, he is the Christ (Messiah), the Son of God, Savior of the world
- To Muslims, he is a revered prophet, born of a virgin, but not God's Son
- To Jews, he was a teacher who didn't fulfill messianic prophecies
- To secularists, he was perhaps a wise moral teacher, but nothing more

This isn't just an academic question. If Jesus is who he claimed to be, it changes everything. How we understand God, ourselves, history, and our eternal destiny.

## Prophecies Fulfilled

For centuries before Jesus' birth, Hebrew prophets wrote specific predictions about a coming Messiah. These weren't vague generalities but detailed descriptions:

- **Genealogy**: Descended from Abraham, through Judah's tribe, from David's royal line
- **Birth**: In Bethlehem, to a virgin, during specific historical window
- **Ministry**: Teaching with authority, healing the sick, gentle yet powerful
- **Death**: Betrayed for thirty pieces of silver, pierced hands and feet, crucified between criminals, buried in a rich man's tomb
- **Resurrection**: Raised from the dead before his body saw decay
- **Exaltation**: Seated at God's right hand with all authority

The probability of one person fulfilling even a fraction of these prophecies by chance is statistically astronomical. Jesus fulfilled them all.

This first path examines:
- What Old Testament Scripture predicted about the Messiah
- How Jesus' life, death, and resurrection aligned with those predictions
- The remarkable precision of fulfilled prophecy
- Why this evidence points compellingly to Jesus as the promised Christ

*The Jewish Scriptures written centuries before Jesus provide a detailed blueprint. Jesus matched it precisely.*

## Honest Questions Answered

Honest skepticism deserves honest answers. If Jesus is truly the Messiah, then legitimate questions should have satisfactory responses.

**Common Objections:**

- "Messiah was supposed to bring political peace—but Rome still ruled and the temple was destroyed"
- "Some prophecies weren't clearly about an individual Messiah"
- "The genealogies in Matthew and Luke differ"
- "Why didn't most Jewish leaders accept Jesus?"
- "Islam teaches Jesus was only a prophet—why believe more?"

This path addresses these objections thoughtfully, showing how:

- **Two-comings model**: Suffering Servant (first coming) and Conquering King (second coming) both predicted in Scripture
- **Unfulfilled prophecies**: Distinction between inaugurated and consummated fulfillment
- **Jesus' unique self-revelation**: What he revealed about God's nature that wasn't explicit in the Old Testament
- **Historical and biblical evidence**: Supporting the New Testament accounts
- **Theological coherence**: How the pieces fit together logically

Additionally, this section explores what Jesus revealed that goes beyond Old Testament expectations:

- The triune nature of God (Father, Son, Holy Spirit)
- Grace through faith, not merely law-keeping
- Love for enemies, not just neighbors
- The kingdom as both present and future ("already/not yet")
- Indwelling Holy Spirit for all believers
- Explicit teaching on resurrection and eternal life

*Questions are welcome. Truth withstands scrutiny.*

## Reconciliation and the New Covenant

**Why did Jesus accomplish?**

**The Problem:**
- Humanity separated from holy God by sin (Romans 3:23, Isaiah 59:2)
- Justice demands penalty for sin: death (Romans 6:23)
- We cannot save ourselves—"no one righteous" (Romans 3:10-12)

**The Old Testament Solution:**
- Animal sacrifices provided temporary covering for sin
- Blood atonement required (Leviticus 17:11)
- People saved by faith looking forward to Messiah (Genesis 15:6)
- System pointed to ultimate sacrifice to come

**Jesus as the Ultimate Sacrifice:**
- Fully God and fully human—uniquely qualified
- Sinless life—able to die for others (1 Peter 2:22)
- Substitutionary death—innocent for guilty (2 Corinthians 5:21)
- Once-for-all sacrifice—no repetition needed (1 Peter 3:18)
- Infinite value—satisfied divine justice (Romans 3:25-26)

**The New Covenant Established:**
God promised through Jeremiah: "I will make a new covenant... I will put my law within them... I will be their God... they shall all know me... I will forgive their iniquity" (Jeremiah 31:31-34).

Jesus fulfilled every element:
- Law written on hearts through Holy Spirit
- Direct relationship with God—no priestly mediator needed
- Complete forgiveness—sins remembered no more

**Why No Physical Temple Needed:**
- Jesus IS the new temple—access to God through him
- Believers ARE the temple—Holy Spirit dwells in us
- Veil torn at crucifixion—barrier removed forever

**Why No More Animal Sacrifices:**
- Jesus' sacrifice sufficient for all time
- "It is finished" (John 19:30)—paid in full
- Faith in his blood, not animal blood, brings forgiveness

**Why Jesus is the ONLY Way:**
- Only sinless substitute acceptable to holy God
- Only person both fully God and fully human
- Only one who conquered death
- "No other name... by which we must be saved" (Acts 4:12)

*God's plan from the beginning: Reconcile humanity to himself through the Messiah.*

## Contemporary Evidence

Jesus isn't merely a historical figure studied in dusty books. People today encounter him—and evidence continues mounting.

**Lee Strobel's Investigation:**

Award-winning journalist Lee Strobel, an atheist with a Yale Law degree, set out to disprove Christianity when his wife converted. His investigative research led to an unexpected conclusion.

Over two years (1980-1982), Strobel interviewed leading scholars in multiple fields:

- **Eyewitness testimony**: Gospels written within one generation by eyewitnesses or direct sources
- **Documentary evidence**: 5,800+ Greek manuscripts, 99.5% textually accurate
- **Corroborating sources**: 10+ non-Christian historians confirm Jesus' existence, crucifixion, and resurrection claims
- **Scientific evidence**: Medical analysis confirms Jesus truly died; resurrection best explains evidence
- **Psychological evidence**: Mass hallucination impossible; 500+ witnesses saw risen Jesus

Strobel's conclusion: "I had seen enough. The evidence was absolutely convincing." He converted to Christianity in November 1981.

**Archaeological Discoveries:**

Recent excavations continue confirming Gospel accounts:

- Pool of Bethesda discovered (John 5:2)
- Pool of Siloam found (John 9:7)
- Pontius Pilate inscription (1961)
- Caiaphas ossuary (1990)
- Crucifixion victim with nail through heel—proves Gospel description

**Non-Christian Historical Sources:**

Enemy attestation from hostile witnesses strengthens the case:

- **Josephus** (Jewish historian): Jesus, wise man, crucified under Pilate, resurrection claims
- **Tacitus** (Roman historian): Christ executed by Pontius Pilate under Tiberius
- **Pliny the Younger** (Roman governor): Christians worship Christ as God, refuse to curse him under torture
- **Babylonian Talmud**: Jesus hanged on Passover, practiced "sorcery," led Israel astray

What enemies confirm:
- Jesus existed
- Performed extraordinary deeds (called "sorcery" by detractors)
- Crucified under Pontius Pilate
- Followers worshiped him as divine
- Movement spread despite intense persecution

**Modern Testimonies:**

Across cultures and backgrounds, people report encountering Jesus:
- Scholarly conversions (philosophers, scientists)
- Muslim visions and dreams (documented phenomenon)
- Miraculous healings with medical documentation
- Near-death experiences consistently mentioning Jesus

*The evidence keeps growing. History supports the Gospels. Lives continue transforming.*

## Why Follow Jesus?

Evidence leads somewhere. If Jesus is who he claimed, the response isn't mere intellectual agreement but personal commitment.

**Because of who he is:**
- The Way, the Truth, and the Life (John 14:6)
- Perfect and sinless (1 Peter 2:22)

**Because of what he's done:**
- Died for our sins while we were still sinners (Romans 5:8)
- Conquered death through resurrection (1 Corinthians 15:54-57)
- Paid the price for our redemption (1 Peter 1:18-19)

**Because of what he promises:**
- Forgiveness of all sins (1 John 1:9)
- Eternal life (John 3:16, 10:28)
- Abundant life now (John 10:10)
- Never leaving or forsaking (Hebrews 13:5)
- Power to become God's children (John 1:12)

**What following looks like:**
- Not religion but relationship (John 17:3)
- Not earning salvation but receiving a gift (Ephesians 2:8-9)
- Not duty but love response (1 John 4:19)
- Empowered by Holy Spirit, not self-effort (Galatians 5:22-23)

**How to begin:**
1. Recognize sinfulness before holy God (Romans 3:23)
2. Believe Jesus died and rose for you (Romans 10:9-10)
3. Repent—turn from sin to God (Acts 3:19)
4. Receive Jesus as Lord and Savior (John 1:12)

*The invitation stands: "Come to Me, all who are weary" (Matthew 11:28).*
