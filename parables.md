# The Parables about the Kingdom of God

Jesus Christ employed parables as a teaching method to explain the nature and characteristics of the Kingdom of God. These narratives, drawn from everyday life, reveal essential truths about entrance into the Kingdom, its value, its growth, and the standards expected of its citizens. This article examines the key parables related to God's Kingdom as recorded in the Gospels, analyzing their theological implications and practical applications.

## Parable of the lamp

> You are [the light](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/metaphors/light) of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden. Nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house. 
> 
> In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may **see your good works** and **give glory to your Father** Who is in heaven.
> 
> — Matthew 5:14-16 (ESV)

Due to the manner in which many modern Bibles divide the text into sections, readers may mistakenly conclude that Jesus' teaching stops here with an open ending. However, the original text of Matthew flows directly into the next statement:

> Do not think that I have come to abolish **the Law or the Prophets**; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. For truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from **the Law** until all is accomplished. — Matthew 5:17-18 (ESV)

This connection suggests that the world measures "the good works" of "the sons of God" according to "the laws or the prophets". If their works are not aligned with these standards, they cannot "give glory to the Father", indicating a moral standard exists for "the sons of God".

Now some Christians would argue, these laws were only relevant to the Jews in Jesus' time, because Jesus "fulfilled the laws" at his [crucifixion](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/crucifixion) which happened only a few year later. Therefore, they assume these "laws" are deprecated and may be ignored today. 

There are 3 problems with this assumption:

1. Jesus' condition was "until heaven and earth pass away". This did not happen yet.
2. Jesus was not teaching the general Jewish population or "the world", but instead he was specifically teaching his disciples (Matthew 5:1). Therefore, these "laws" applied to his disciples.
3. If Jesus was about to deprecate the laws, the following warning would make no sense:

> Therefore whoever relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least **in the kingdom of heaven**, but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great **in the kingdom of heaven**. — Matthew 5:19 (ESV)

Note that both those who "relax" and those who "teach" these commandments are "in the kingdom of heaven". This implies that "good works" are not a condition for [salvation](https://eternal.family.net.za/eternal/saved). [Salvation cannot be earned](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/crucifixion), no matter the effort expended. Jesus also makes this point in the next verse:

> For I tell you, unless your [righteousness](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/righteousness) exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, **you will never enter the kingdom of heaven**. — Matthew 5:20 (ESV)

Many struggle to explain what "righteousness" means. In perhaps oversimplified layman's terms, it simply means to be in right standing (good relationship) with God. However, one cannot be in right standing with any person without trust or if [unforgiven issues](darkness.md) exist between them. The same principle applies to God. 

"Righteousness" with God is only possible if one at least:
1. [trusts (believes in) God](https://eternal.family.net.za/eternal/saved/belief), and
2. [repents](https://eternal.family.net.za/eternal/saved/repent) from [sin](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/sin) against God

Obviously this requires [humility](#who-is-part-of-the-kingdom-of-god).

In the subsequent chapters, Jesus explains what he meant by "the laws and the prophets" (Matthew 7:12). He begins by clarifying that righteousness is not limited to the relationship with God, but disciples should also live in right standing with others (Matthew 6:14-15):

> “You have heard that it was said to those of old, 
> 
>> You shall not murder — Exodus 20:13; Deuteronomy 5:17
> 
> and whoever murders will be liable to judgment. 
> 
> But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment;   
> whoever insults his brother will be liable to the council; and   
> whoever says, ‘You fool!’ will be liable to the hell of fire.   
> 
> So if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, **leave your gift there before the altar and go. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.** Come to terms quickly with your accuser while you are going with him to court, lest your accuser hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the guard, and you be put in prison. Truly, I say to you, you will never get out until you have paid the last penny.
> 
> — Matthew 5:21-26 (ESV)

This teaching extends beyond interpersonal conflict to include lust (Matthew 5:27-30), divorce (Matthew 5:31-32), breaking commitments (Matthew 5:33-37), and retaliation (Matthew 5:38-42). All of these destroy relationships, and disciples should guard against them to maintain right standing with others as well.

However, staying out of trouble is not Jesus' standard. He goes another step further and teaches:

> You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ 
> 
> But I say to you, 'Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you', so that you may be [sons of your Father Who is in heaven](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/sons-of-god). 
> 
> For He makes His sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust. 
> 
> For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? 
> Do not even the tax collectors do the same? 
> And if you greet only your brothers, what more are you doing than others? 
> Do not even the Gentiles do the same? 
> 
> **You therefore must be *perfect [complete or mature](https://biblehub.com/greek/5046.htm)***, as your heavenly Father is *perfect*.
> 
> — Matthew 5:43-48 (ESV)

This is God's standard for His sons.

Then Jesus warns that God does not approve hypocrisy (Matthew 6:1-5; 16-18) and explains that our relationship of God is not something to boast about (Matthew 6:6-8).

Jesus also warns against [distractions from God's kingdom work](darkness.md), including greed (Matthew 6:19-24), anxiety (Matthew 6:25-34), judgmental behavior (Matthew 7:1-6), and any attempt to live independent of God (Matthew 7:7-11). Removing God from His kingdom renders it no longer God's kingdom.

Then Jesus summarizes his teaching by saying:

> So whatever you wish that others would do to you, do also to them, for **this is the Law and the Prophets**. — Matthew 7:12 (ESV)

These "laws" are not comfortable. It is hard but worth it because it leads to life (Matthew 7:13-14).

## Parable of the good and bad fruit

> Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves. You will **recognize them by their fruits**. 
> 
> Are grapes gathered from thornbushes, or figs from thistles? 
> 
> So, every healthy tree bears good fruit, but the diseased tree bears bad fruit. A healthy tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a diseased tree bear good fruit. 
> 
> Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. 
> 
> Thus you will **recognize them by their fruits**.
> 
> — Matthew 7:15-20 (ESV)

This explains why those who do not bear "good fruit" (the will of God) are ineffective in God's kingdom.

Jesus will also judge people according to their "fruit":

> “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter **the kingdom of heaven**, but the one who **does the will of My Father** Who is in heaven. 
> 
> On that day many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?’ 
> 
> And then will I declare to them, ‘I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.’
> 
> — Matthew 7:21-23 (ESV)

## Parable of the house on the rock

To guard against [false teachings](#parable-of-the-good-and-bad-fruit), disciples ought to anchor themselves to his teachings by living them:

> Everyone then who hears these words of mine and **does them** will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock. And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock. 
> 
> And everyone who hears these words of mine and **does not do them** will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell, and great was the fall of it.
> 
> And when Jesus finished these sayings, the crowds were astonished at his teaching, for he was teaching them as one who had authority, and not as their scribes.
> 
> — Matthew 7:24-28 (ESV)

Any theory, whether secular or spiritual, requires some proof.

If one only relies on another's testimony (merely hearing Jesus' words without practical experience), that person will be easily convinced by false teachings or will compromise during storms of persecution.

Conversely, when a disciple has tested Jesus' words through personal experience, has witnessed how God provided during times of obedience, and has firsthand observed the effects of obedience on self and others, nothing will convince that person to believe otherwise.

Matthew 8-9 records how Jesus ministered to people. Often modern ministries are limited to preaching, but Matthew records that Jesus healed people, counseled individuals, saved his disciples from a storm, visited sinners, cast out demons, and raised a girl from the dead.

After Jesus set these examples, he instructed his 12 disciples in Matthew 10 to continue the ministry he had started.

Matthew 11-12 records how John, Jesus, and his disciples experienced resistance from some citizens and Pharisees.

Then Jesus explains why their ministry is ineffective in some cases.

## Parable of the sower

> And great crowds gathered about him *[Jesus]*, so that he got into a boat and sat down. And the whole crowd stood on the beach. And he told them many things in parables, saying: 
> 
> “A sower went out to sow. And as he sowed, 
> 
> 1. some seeds fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured them. 
> 2. Other seeds fell on rocky ground, where they did not have much soil, and immediately they sprang up, since they had no depth of soil, but when the sun rose they were scorched. And since they had no root, they withered away. 
> 3. Other seeds fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them. 
> 4. Other seeds fell on good soil and produced grain, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty. 
> 
> He who has ears, let him hear.”
> 
> — Matthew 13:3-9 (ESV)

Then Jesus explains the parable:

> Hear then the parable of the sower: 
> 
> When anyone hears the word of **the kingdom** and  
> 1. does not *understand [[put together / to comprehend](https://biblehub.com/greek/4920.htm)]* it, the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart. This is what was sown along the path. 
> 2. As for what was sown on rocky ground, this is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy, yet he has no root in himself, but endures for a while, and when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately he falls away.
> 3. As for what was sown among thorns, this is the one who hears the word, but the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and it proves unfruitful. 
> 4. As for what was sown on good soil, this is the one who hears the word and *understand [[put together / to comprehend](https://biblehub.com/greek/4920.htm)]* it. He indeed bears fruit and yields, in one case a hundredfold, in another sixty, and in another thirty.
> 
> — Matthew 13:18-23 (ESV)

The English definition of "understand" suggests mere awareness, knowledge, or learning. This seems unfair toward the audience who failed to understand what Jesus had said. Was Jesus an ineffective teacher?

However, the Greek definition of "understand" is to "put together" or "to comprehend". In other words, the audience bears responsibility to synthesize and make an effort to comprehend what they just learned. This means practically applying the teaching to their own lives.

## Parable of the mustard seed

> He put another parable before them, saying, "The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his field. It is the smallest of all seeds, but when it has grown it is larger than all the garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches."
>
> He told them another parable. "The kingdom of heaven is like leaven that a woman took and hid in three measures of flour, till it was all leavened." — Matthew 13:31-33 (ESV)

The Kingdom may begin as something seemingly insignificant in a person's life, but it grows to dominate and transform everything.

## Parables of the treasures

Jesus taught his disciples the supreme value of God's kingdom through two brief parables:

> "The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and covered up. Then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field.
>
> Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls, who, on finding one pearl of great value, went and sold all that he had and bought it." 
>
> — Matthew 13:44-46 (ESV)

Both men recognized something of supreme value and willingly gave up everything to obtain it. This is the attitude required for those who would enter God's kingdom.

## Parable of the unexpected thief

Jesus also warns that [God's judgement](https://eternal.family.net.za/eternal/judgement), will be unexpected:

> “But concerning that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father only. For as were the days of Noah, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day when Noah entered the ark, and they were unaware until the flood came and swept them all away, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
>
> Then two men will be in the field; one will be taken and one left.   
> Two women will be grinding at the mill; one will be taken and one left.
>
> — Matthew 24:36-42 (ESV)

Jesus warns that the Lord's judgement will come at an unexpected time:

> Therefore, stay awake, for **you do not know on what day your Lord is coming**. 
> 
> But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what part of the night the thief was coming, he would have stayed awake and would not have let his house be broken into. 
> 
> Therefore **you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect**.
> 
> — Matthew 24:43-44 (ESV)

According to what will we be judged?

Jesus' next parables give the answer.

## Parable of the servants

> Who then is the faithful and wise servant?
> 
> Whom his master has set over his household, to **give them their food at the proper time**. Blessed is that servant whom his master will find so doing when he comes. Truly, I say to you, he will set him over all his possessions. 
> 
> But if that wicked servant says to himself, ‘My master is delayed,’ and begins to beat his fellow servants and eats and drinks with drunkards, the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know and will cut him in pieces and put him with the hypocrites. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. 
> 
> — Matthew 24:45-51 (ESV)

## Parable of the virgins

> Then **the kingdom of heaven** will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom. Five of them were foolish, and five were wise. For when the foolish took their lamps, they took no oil with them, but the wise took flasks of oil with their lamps. As the bridegroom was delayed, they all became drowsy and slept. 
> 
> But at midnight there was a cry, ‘Here is the bridegroom! Come out to meet him.’ 
> 
> Then all those virgins rose and trimmed their lamps. 
> 
> And the foolish said to the wise, ‘Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.’ 
> But the wise answered, saying, ‘Since there will not be enough for us and for you, go rather to the dealers and buy for yourselves.’ 
> 
> And while they were going to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut. 
> 
> Afterward the other virgins came also, saying, ‘Lord, lord, open to us.’   
> But he answered, ‘Truly, I say to you, I do not know you.’ 
> 
> Watch therefore, for **you know neither the day nor the hour**.
> 
> — Matthew 25:1-13 (ESV)

## Parable of the stewards

> For it will be like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted to them his property. To one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one, to each according to his ability. Then he went away. 
> 
> He who had received the five talents went at once and traded with them, and he made five talents more. 
> 
> So also he who had the two talents made two talents more. 
> 
> But he who had received the one talent went and dug in the ground and hid his master's money. 
> 
> Now after a long time the master of those servants came and settled accounts with them. 
> 
> And he who had received the five talents came forward, bringing five talents more, saying, ‘Master, you delivered to me five talents; here I have made five talents more.’ His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master.’ 
> 
> And he also who had the two talents came forward, saying, ‘Master, you delivered to me two talents; here I have made two talents more.’ His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master.’ 
> 
> He also who had received the one talent came forward, saying, ‘Master, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you scattered no seed, so I was afraid, and I went and hid your talent in the ground. Here you have what is yours.’ But his master answered him, ‘You wicked and slothful servant! You knew that I reap where I have not sown and gather where I scattered no seed? Then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers, and at my coming I should have received what was my own with interest. So take the talent from him and give it to him who has the ten talents. 
> 
> For to everyone who has will more be given, and he will have an abundance. But from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away. And cast the worthless servant into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
>
> — Matthew 25:14-30 (ESV)

## Conclusion

The parables of the Kingdom of God presented in the Gospels establish several foundational principles. 

Entry into the Kingdom requires righteousness that exceeds mere external compliance, rooted in genuine faith, repentance, and humility. Citizens of the Kingdom demonstrate their citizenship through good works that align with the Law and the Prophets, summarized in the principle of treating others as one wishes to be treated. The Kingdom's growth may appear insignificant initially but ultimately transforms everything it touches. Its value surpasses all earthly treasures, warranting total commitment. Finally, readiness for Christ's return requires faithful stewardship of entrusted responsibilities, persistent spiritual preparation, and ongoing obedience to God's will. 

These parables collectively present a Kingdom characterized by moral excellence, sacrificial commitment, and active faithfulness.
