# World of Darkness


## The Owner of our world

If one consider all the suffering, injustice and wickeness in our world, it is easy to belief that the devil is reigning over our world. However, the Bible scriptures says otherwise:

### God owns everything

> **The earth is [the LORD](/content/kingdom/god/father/name.md#yhvh)’s, and all its fullness, the world and those who dwell therein.** -- Psalms 24:1 (NKJV)

And King David believed God is the supreme ruler:

> [The LORD](/content/kingdom/god/father/name.md#yhvh) has established His throne in heaven, and **His kingdom rules over all**.  
> Bless the LORD, you His angels, who excel in strength, who do His word, heeding the voice of His word.  
> Bless the LORD, all you His hosts, you ministers of His, who do His pleasure.  
> Bless the LORD, all His works, in all places of His dominion.  
> Bless the LORD, O my soul!
>
> -- Psalms 103:19-22 (NKJV)

and

> Therefore David blessed [The LORD](/content/kingdom/god/father/name.md#yhvh) before all the assembly; and David said:
>
> “Blessed are You, Lord God of Israel, our [Father](/content/kingdom/god/father.md), forever and ever.  
> Yours, O Lord, is the greatness: the power and the glory, the victory and the majesty;  
> For **all that is in heaven and in earth is Yours**;  
> **Yours is the kingdom**, O Lord, and **You are exalted as head over all**.  
> Both riches and honor come from You, and **You reign over all**.
> In Your hand is power and might;
> In Your hand it is to make great and to give strength to all.
>
> -- 1 Chronicles 29:10-12 (NKJV)

This teaching was also echoed by Jehoshaphat (2 Chronicles 20:5-9).

In addition, Jesus also implied that God is in control even to the smallest detail:

> Are not two sparrows sold for a copper coin?
>
> And not one of them falls to the ground apart from your Father’s will.
>
> But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.
>
> -- Matthew 10:29-30 (NKJV)

### Delegated authority to humanity

Though God is the absolute sovereign and owner, He chose to delegate real authority to humanity:

> Then God said, “Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; **let them have dominion**
>
> - over the fish of the sea,
> - over the birds of the air, and
> - over the cattle, over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.”
>
> -- Genesis 1:26 (NKJV)

Some reason that [the fall of man](/content/kingdom/eternal.md) cancelled this privilege based on the devil's own words: 

> And the devil took him up and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time, and said to him *(Jesus)*, 
>
> “To you I will give all this authority and their glory, for **it has been delivered to me**, and I give it to whom I will. 
>
> -- Luke 4:5-6 ESV

Jesus never challenged this claim. However, in the same book of Genesis we also read:

> God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them:
>
> “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth. And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be on every beast of the earth, on every bird of the air, on all that move on the earth, and on all the fish of the sea. **They are given into your hand**.”
>
> -- Genesis 9:1-2 (NKJV)

This means that the original command God gave Adam and Eve never expired. Noah and his sons were still authorized to have dominion. God never delivered the world to the devil. We, as humans who are supposed to have dominion, deliver it to him.

King David also wrote:

> What is man that You are mindful of him?
> And the son of man that You visit him?
>
> For You have made him a little lower than the angels,
> And You have crowned him with glory and honor.
> **You have made him to have dominion** over the works of Your hands;
> **You have put all things under his feet**, all sheep and oxen — even the beasts of the field, the birds of the air, and the fish of the sea that pass through the paths of the seas.
>
> -- Psalms 8:4-8 (NKJV)

God gave humans genuine dominion - authority that could be used properly or abused. This sets the stage for understanding how evil entered the world.

## The Battle for Control

We were given dominion, but we lost it. How? Through idolatry - the root of all sin:

> Therefore put to death your members which are on the earth: fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, **which is idolatry**. -- Colossians 3:5 (NKJV)

[Sin](/content/kingdom/bible/concepts/sin.md) is caused by [idolatry](/content/kingdom/bible/concepts/idolatry.md).

> Then his mind changes, and he **transgresses; He commits offense, ascribing this [power](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/3581.htm) to his god**. -- Habakkuk 1:11 (NKJV)

According to Habakkuk, idolatry is "ascribing power" [(ability, might, strength, wealth)](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/3581.htm) to another "god". Simply put: 

**Prioritizing anything above God is the root of all sin.**

> **No one can serve two masters**; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be loyal to the one and despise the other. **You cannot serve God and mammon.**. Therefore I say to you, **do not worry** about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink; nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food and the body more than clothing? -- Matthew 6:24-25 (NKJV)

The reason why we worry or serve two masters is because we don't trust God. 

### 1. Doubting God

Jesus explained through the parable of the sower why we fail to trust God (Mark 4:2-20; Matthew 13:3-23; Luke 8:4-18):

* Deception (wayside) (1 Timothy 4:1-2):
  * Ignorance: We become vulnerable to deception when uninformed about God (for example the Athenes (Acts 17:22-23))
  * Lies: We may know about God but have a distorted view (for example the samaritan woman (John 4:1-42))
  * Skepticism: We may know the truth but won't commit until we see evidence (for example Moses (Exodus 3-4), Gideon (Judges 6-7), Thomas (John 20:24-29))
  * Rejection: We may refuse to believe despite evidence (for example the "fools" mentioned in Psalm 14:1; 53:1)
* Convenience (rocky ground): We trust God as long as it's comfortable, but when persecution comes, we abandon Him (for example the Israelites (Exodus 32), Peter (Matthew 26:69-75), Demas (2 Timothy 4:10))
* Distractions (thorny ground): Our distractions come in different forms:
  * Obligations: We prioritize "the cares of this world" above God (for example the refuser (Luke 9:59-62))
  * Wealth: We prioritize "the riches of this world" above God (for example the rich man (Luke 18:18-25))
  * Popularity: We prioritize "the desires of others" above God (for example Adam (Genesis 3), King Saul (1 Samuel 13, 15), King Solomon (1 Kings 11), King Ahab (1 Kings 18))

#### Consequences of doubt

When we doubt God, we seek **independance from God** because **we do not trust** that God will meet our needs.

When we are independant from God:

* We lack God's **provision**, therefore we become **discontent**, because we become discontent with what we have.
* We lack God's **protection**, therefore we become **fearful**, because we are insecure.
* We lack God's **authority**, therefore we become **proud**, because we seek acknowledgement by self elevation or entitlement.

Even Jesus had to face these same temptations (Matthew 4; Luke 4):

* "command that these stones become bread" (challenge God's provision by requesting Jesus to provide for himself)
* "throw yourself down" (challenge God's protection by testing God)
* "all these things I will give you" (challenge God's authority by providing an alternative to the crucifixion)

> **Trust in the LORD** with all your heart, and lean not on your own understanding; In all your ways acknowledge Him, And He shall direct your paths. Do not be wise in your own eyes; **Fear the LORD and depart from evil**. -- Proverbs 3:5-7 (NKJV)

Our lack of trust in God makes us vulnerable to temptations.

### 2. Coping mechanisms

We are all mortal beings that need godly provision, protection and acknowledgement. We were not meant to live independantly from God. Without God, we have to resort to coping mechanisms.

It would be impossible to list every single sin here. These are just some over-simplified scenarios to illustrate that every coping mechanism leads to some sort of sin. 

#### Coping with discontentment
* Jealousy: Discontent with God's provision, therefore they covet what other people have - this often leads to envy, slander, theft or murder
* Gluttony: Discontent with situation, therefore resorting to overconsumption as a coping mechanism - often at the cost of their health
* Lust: Discontent with the level of intimacy with God, therefore they resort to sexual gratification as a substitute which leads to sexual fantasies, seduction, kidnapping or rape.
* Greed: Discontent with God's provision, therefore they hoard resources - often at the cost of others
* Slothfulness: Often associated with people who gave up hope (Proverbs 21:25–26) - often leads to despair

#### Coping with fear
* Wrath: Fear they need to defend themselves against an offender by responding with wrath which may lead to malice.
* Manipulation: Fear they need to control others which may lead to betrayal, extortion, deception, bribery, witchcraft, rebellion, etc.
* Compromise: Some fear rejections by people more than God's authority. This often leads to disobedience.
* Apostasy: Fear of divine abandonment, therefore they create substitute gods or systems to replace God
* Greed: Fear that they may lack in the future, therefore they hoard resources - often at the cost of others
* Slothfulness: Some fear failure (Proverbs 22:13; Ecclesiastes 11:4) - leads to unnecessary procrastination and damage

#### Pride
Pride is present when we do not acknowledge God's authority.
* Arrogance: Disregard God's authority by self-idolization may lead to disrespectful behavior which may encourage others to retaliate in response.
* Impatience: Disregard God's timing because they believe they know better than God - this often leads to theft, disobedience, rebellion or violence
* Revenge: Disregard God's judgement, therefore they choose to execute their own justice to "get even" which leads to an active sin like spite, slander, theft, vandalism, murder, etc.
* Resentment: Disregard God's judgement, but cannot execute own justice, so they resort to passive sin like envy, bitterness and unforgiveness.
* Slothfulness: Caused by entitlement or pride (Proverbs 26:16) - leads to neglecting responsibilities and damage

### 3. Defilement

Sin always defiles what God declared [holy](/content/kingdom/bible/concepts/holy.md) or honoured like:

* Time: Dedicated time for special events or sabaths (Genesis 2:3; Exodus 16:22-26, 31:14-15, 35:2; Deuteronomy 5:12)
* Environment: Land, cities, water and air (Exodus 3:4-5, 15:13, 26:33-34, 28:35, 28:42-43, 29:31, 40:9-11, Joshua 5:15).
* Life: Human and animal bodies or lifes (Exodus 12:16-17; 19:3-6; 29:21, 29:32-33, 30:29-30; Leviticus 11:44-45; 19:1-2; 20:7; 21:1-9; 2 Peter 3:1-2)
* Objects: Sacred items (Exodus 28:2-4,36; 29:21,29; 29:6; 30:33; 39:30; 40:10; Numbers 5:17; Joshua 6:19; 2 Chronicles 35:3)
* Data: Truth, knowledge and wisdom (Proverbs 9:10; Daniel 11:32; Hosea 4:6; John 17:17)
* Sound: Praise and music (Hebrews 13:15; Psalm 99:5, Psalm 150:6)
* Relationship: Marriage and covenants (Hebrews 13:4; Malachi 2:14-15)

There are many more example in the Bible.

### 4. Seperation from God

Our sins create a cascade of defilement which separates us from our Holy God.

> Behold, the LORD’s hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; Nor His ear heavy, that it cannot hear. 
>
> But **your iniquities have separated you from your God**; And **your sins have hidden His face from you**, so that **He will not hear**. 
>
> * For **your hands are defiled with blood**, 
> * And **your fingers with iniquity**; 
> * **Your lips have spoken lies**, 
> * **Your tongue has muttered perversity**.
>
> -- Isaiah 59:1-3 (NKJV)

### 5. Guilt

The universal principle is that when someone was wronged, someone needs to "pay" for the damage (for example: Exodus 22:1-15; Numbers 5:6-7; Leviticus 6:1-5).

> But in accordance with your hardness and your impenitent heart **you are treasuring up for yourself wrath** in the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God, who 
>
>> “will render to each one according to his deeds”: 
>
> * eternal life to those who by patient continuance in doing good seek for glory, honor, and immortality; 
> * but to those who are **self-seeking** and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness—indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish, on every soul of man who does evil
>
> -- Romans 2:5-9 (NKJV)

That is why the accuser as the right to condemn sinners (for example Job 1:6-12; 2:1-7 and Zechariah 3:1-5). Therefore sinners experience condemning emotions like anxiety, guilt and shame (Numbers 32:23). Genesis 3 provides a detailed illustration how this played out for the first humans who committed the first sin.

To cope with condemnation, we resort to more coping mechanisms, creating more sin. It's like trying to extinguish fire with oil. We believe the lie that we have "no choice" or must "temporarily" do wrong.

## How the devil rules

While it might seem like the devil is the god of this world, he technically does not own anyone or even have any dominion by himself. 

> Satan [the adversary] stood up against Israel and incited David to count [the population of] Israel. -- 1 Chronicles 21:1 (AMP)

This is how the devil "rules" the world:
1. The devil tempts us to **doubt God** usually by:
  * deception: ignorance, lies, skepticism or rejection of the truth
  * convenience: prioritize comfort above obedience
  * distractions: proritize wordly obligrations, wealth, popularity above God
2. When we doubt God, we seek **independance from God**
3. When we are independant from God, we:
  * lack God's provision, therefore we become **discontent** with what we have
  * lack God's protection, therefore we become **fearful** because we are insecure
  * lack God's acknowledgement, therefore we become **proud** because we elevate ourselves
4. Our discontent, fear or pride leads to **coping mechanisms** (selfish desires) like jealousy, gluttony, lust, greed, slothfulness, wrath, manipulation, compromise, apastasy, greed, arrogance, impatience, revenge, resentment, etc.
5. All these selfish desires leads to **sin**
6. All sin causes **defilement** of time, environment, life, objects, data, sound, relationships
7. Defilement has 3 consequences:
   * God is holy and do not compromise on defilement. Therefore we are **separated from God** ([unrighteousness](/content/kingdom/bible/concepts/righteousness.md))
   * Defilement causes corruption, damage, pain and death to God's creation
   * Guilt leads to condemnation which leads to destruction and death
8. To compensate for these consequences, we apply **more coping mechanisms** independant from God
9. The more coping mechanisms we apply, the **more we sin**
10. The more we sin, the more **enslaved** we become to the devices of the devil like:

* abusive relationships
* addiction
* bitterness
* depression
* illness (mental or physical)
* isolation
* loneliness
* poverty
* self deception
* and so forth...

This vicious cycle keeps the devil in control of our lives.

> We look for light, but there is **darkness**! For brightness, but we walk in **blackness**! We grope for the wall like the **blind**, and we grope as if we had **no eyes**; We **stumble at noonday as at twilight**; We are as **dead men in desolate places**.
>
> We all growl like bears, and moan sadly like doves; 
> 
> We **look for justice, but there is none**; For salvation, but it is far from us. 
>
> For our **transgressions are multiplied** before You, and **our sins testify against us**; For our transgressions are with us, and as for our iniquities, we know them: In transgressing and lying against the LORD, and **departing from our God**, speaking oppression and revolt, Conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.
>
> -- Isaiah 59:4-13 (NKJV)

Isaiah noticed the same pattern we experience: iniquity -> cover up by (running to more evil) -> even more iniquity

We become trapped in this vicious cycle experiencing no peace, no justice, spiritual blindness (deception) because our sin separates us from God.
 
> Jesus answered them, "Most assuredly, I say to you, whoever commits sin **is a slave of sin**." -- John 8:34 (NKJV)

According to (Luke 4:18-21), Jesus also quoted:

> “The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, because the Lord has anointed me to preach good tidings to **the poor**; He has sent me to 
> * heal **the brokenhearted**, 
> * to proclaim liberty to **the captives**, and 
> * the opening of the prison to **those who are bound**;
>
> -- Isaiah 61:1 (NKJV)

### The Kingdom of Darkness

Scripture does not reveals two competing gods, but one sovereign God and a rebellious creature who exploits human disobedience. Paul clarifies:

> But even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing, **whose minds the god of this age has blinded**, who do not [believe](/content/kingdom/life/faith.md)... -- 2 Corinthians 4:3-4 (NKJV)

However, in this context it means that "those whose minds are blinded" follow a false "god" instead of the true God. Paul explains it more clearly in Ephesians:

> And you were dead in trespasses and sins, in which **you once walked according to the course of this world**, according to **[the ruler](https://biblehub.com/greek/758.htm) of [the authority](https://biblehub.com/greek/1849.htm)** of the air, of **the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience**, among whom also we all once lived:
> - in **the lusts of our flesh**, doing the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and 
> were by nature children of **wrath**, as also the rest.
>
> -- Eph`siyim / Ephesians 2:1-3 TS2009 

*Note: Some [bible translations](/content/kingdom/bible/translations.md) like the NIV replace "authority" with "kingdom" which is an incorrect translation of the book of Ephesians according to the Strong's Concordance. Other bible translations like the KJV or ESV replaces "authority" with "power" which could be correct as long as we understand that the devil received his "power" by "the authority" that we gave him in our disobedience to God.*

"The ruler" is an evil spirit that tempt us to be disobedient by lust and wrath so that we may loose our God given authority. Sin makes us vulnerable to "the wicked one"'s influence according to John:

> We know that **whoever is born of God does not sin**; but he who has been born of God keeps himself, and **the wicked one does not touch him**. We know that we are of God, and **the whole world lies under the sway of the wicked one**. -- 1 John 5:18-19 (NKJV)

Jesus identified the devil's primary weapon against us: deception

> Jesus said to them,
>
> “If God were your Father, you would love me, for I came from God and I am here. I came not of my own accord, but he sent me.
>
> Why do you not understand what I say?
>
> It is because you cannot bear to hear my word. You are of **your father the devil**, and your will is to **do your father’s desires**.
>
> - **He was a murderer** from the beginning, and
> - **does not stand in the truth**, because there is no truth in him.
> - When **he lies**, he speaks out of his own character, for he is a liar and the father of lies.
>
> But because **I tell the truth**, you do not believe me.
>
> Which one of you convicts me of sin?  
> If I tell the truth, why do you not believe me?
>
> Whoever is of God hears the words of God. The reason why you do not hear them is that you are not of God.”
>
> -- John 8:42-47 ESV

A few chapters further, Jesus calls himself "the shepherd" (also a ruler) and then contrast himself with "the thief" in John 10:1-16 which we can assume is "the devil".

> The thief does not come except to steal, and to kill, and to destroy. -- John 10:10 (NKJV)

Then a few chapters later Jesus announced:

> Now is the judgment of this world; now **the ruler of this world** will be cast out. -- John 12:31 (NKJV)

This implies, that "the ruler of this world" has no legal right to own a kingdom in this world. In John 16:7-11 Jesus explained that the Holy Spirit will judge "the ruler of this world".

> I will no longer talk much with you, for **the ruler of this world** is coming. He has no claim on me, but **I do as the Father has commanded me**, so that the world may know that I love the Father. Rise, let us go from here. -- John 14:30-31 ESV

This implies, that "the ruler of this world" was trying to get Jesus to disobey the Father to break down his relationship with his Father.

Jesus also prayed:

> I do not pray that You should take them out of the world, but that You should keep them from **the evil one**. They are **not of the world**, just as **I am not of the world**. -- John 17:15-16 (NKJV)

Jesus was not referring to the devil's kingdom, but instead he addressed the people who were trapped in the deceptions of the world, because after this statement he prayed:

> As You sent me into the world, **I also have sent them into the world**. -- John 17:18 (NKJV)

Jesus would never sent his disciples away to join "the evil one's" kingdom. Instead, "the world" are the people who are deceived and by "the evil one".

> When he *(Jesus)* saw the crowds, he had compassion for them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep **without a shepherd**. Then he said to his disciples, “The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few; therefore pray earnestly to the Lord of the harvest **to send out laborers into his harvest**.” -- Matthew 9:36-38 ESV

One of these disciples were Paul, who explained that he saw in his vision where Jesus told him:

> I will deliver you from the Jewish people, as well as from the Gentiles, to whom I now send you, to open their eyes, in order to **turn them from darkness to light**, and **from the power of Satan to God**, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who are sanctified by faith in me.’ -- Acts 26:17 (NKJV)

We have not been left under the mercy of evil rulers who are under the influence of "the evil one". Paul testified it in Acts 26:17 and well as Daniel who were exiled to Babilon said:

> He *(God)* removes kings and raises up kings. -- Daniel 2:21 (NKJV)

## Defeating darkness

### Deliverance

> He *(God, the Father)* has **delivered us from the power of darkness** and conveyed us into [the kingdom of the Son](/content/kingdom/kingdom.md) of His love, in whom we have [redemption through his blood](/content/kingdom/god/covenants/christ.md), the forgiveness of sins. -- Colossians 1:13-14 (NKJV)

"The power" that the devil have is nothing but a "legal demand" of "debt":

> And you, who were dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses, by **canceling the record of debt that stood against us with its legal demands**. This He set aside, nailing it to the cross. **He disarmed the rulers and authorities** and put them to open shame, by triumphing over them in him. -- Colossians 2:13-15 ESV

Our enemy is not people, but the evil spirits that influence them (especially those in authority) to make bad decisions.

> Therefore I exhort first of all that [supplications, prayers, intercessions](#the-armor-of-god), and giving of thanks be made for all men, **for kings and all who are in authority**, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and reverence. For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, **Who desires all men to be saved** and to come to the knowledge of the truth. -- 1 Timothy 2:1-4 (NKJV)

Evil spirit are not limited to temptation, they could also cause disabilities:

> And behold, there was a woman who had had **a disabling spirit** for eighteen years. She was bent over and could not fully straighten herself.
> 
> When Jesus saw her, he called her over and said to her, “Woman, you are freed from your disability.” 
> 
> And he laid his hands on her, and immediately she was made straight, and she glorified God. 
>
> -- Luke 13:11-13 ESV 

This authority was not limited to Jesus only:

> And he (Jesus) called to him his twelve disciples and gave them **authority over unclean spirits**: 
> * to cast them out, and 
> * to heal every disease and every affliction. 
>
> The names of the twelve apostles are these: 
1. first, Simon, who is called Peter, and 
2. Andrew his brother; 
3. James the son of Zebedee, and 
4. John his brother; 
5. Philip and 
6. Bartholomew; 
7. Thomas and 
8. Matthew the tax collector; 
9. James the son of Alphaeus, and 
10. Thaddaeus; 
11. Simon the Zealot, and 
12. **Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him**. 
>
> -- Matthew 10:1-4 (ESV)

If Judas the betrayer was given this authority, then it means that this authority was not based on the person's character.

> Proclaim as you go, saying, 
>
> ‘The kingdom of heaven is at hand.’
>
> **Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse lepers, cast out demons**. 
>
> You received without paying; give without pay. 
>
> -- Matthew 10:7-8 (ESV); Mark 6:7; Luke 10:17

Some argue that this command was only given to Jesus' direct disciples, but Mark 6 and Luke 10 clearly shows that this authority was also given to the "72 others":

> After this the Lord appointed seventy-two others and sent them on ahead of him, two by two, into every town and place where he himself was about to go
>
> ...
>
> The seventy-two returned with joy, saying, “Lord, even the demons are subject to us in your [name *(authority)*](/content/kingdom/bible/concepts/name.md)!” 
>
> -- Luke 10:1,17 (ESV)

John witnessed that Jesus taught:

> “Truly, truly, I say to you, **whoever** believes in me **will also do the works that I do; and greater works than these will he do**, because I am going to the Father. Whatever you ask in my [name *(authority)*](/content/kingdom/bible/concepts/name.md), this I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If you ask me anything in my [name *(authority)*](/content/kingdom/bible/concepts/name.md), I will do it. -- John 14:12-14 ESV

The name "Jesus" is not some magic word that forces demons into submission. The key is to ask in Jesus' authority. Authority is received by humility:

> Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? 
>
> Whoever therefore wants to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God. Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain, 
>
>> “The Spirit who dwells in us yearns jealously”?
>
> But He gives more grace. Therefore He says: 
>
>> “God resists the proud, But gives grace to the humble.” 
>
> Therefore:
> * **submit to God**: **Resist the devil and he will flee from you**. 
> * **Draw near to God and He will draw near to you**.
> * **Cleanse your hands**, you sinners; and **purify your hearts**, you double-minded. Lament and mourn and weep! Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom. 
> * **Humble yourselves** in the sight of the Lord, and **He will lift you up**. 
>
> -- James 4:4-10 (NKJV)

Submition is often associated with weekness. Ironically when we submit to God, He gives us the authority to resist the devil such that he will flee from us. Submition to God means to set ourselves apart for God purposes which often conflicts with "friendship with the world". We cannot be "double-minded" and expect the devil to "flee" from us.

However, chasing devils around should neve be our main focus. After the 72 disciples reported to Jesus their success, Jesus responded:

> Nevertheless do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but **rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven**.” -- Luke 10:20 (NKJV)

Your goal should be to "draw near to God": This means you need to "cleanse" (repent) from our sin, "purity your heart" (thoughts) in humility.

Humility is often associated with powerlessness, but ironically it is the humble that "the Lord will lift up".

### Changing Your Thoughts

> **Be anxious for nothing**, but in everything **by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God**; and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will **guard your hearts and minds** through Christ Jesus. Finally, brethren, 
> * whatever things are true, 
> * whatever things are noble, 
> * whatever things are just, 
> * whatever things are pure, 
> * whatever things are lovely, 
> * whatever things are of good report, 
> if there is any virtue and if there is anything praiseworthy — **meditate on these things**. The things which you learned and received and heard and saw in me, these do, and **the God of peace will be with you**. 
>
> -- Philippians 4:6-7 (NKJV)

You need to guard your thoughts ("heart"):

> **Watch over your heart** with all diligence, for from it flow the springs of life. -- Proverbs 4:23 (AMP)

Paul advises:

> If then you were raised with Christ, **seek those things which are above**, where Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God. **Set your mind on things above**, not on things on the earth. -- Colossians 3:1-2 (NKJV)

However, a positive attitude is not enough. You must also get rid of anything that even tempts you to commit sin in your thoughts:

> But I say to you that whoever looks at a woman to lust for her **has already committed adultery with her in his heart**. If your right eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and cast it from you; for it is more profitable for you that one of your members perish, than for your whole body to be cast into hell. And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and cast it from you; for **it is more profitable for you that one of your members perish, than for your whole body to be cast into hell**. -- Matthew 5:28-30 (NKJV)

For example, you should avoid bad company who tempt you to commit sin and instead focus on God's teachings:

> Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stands in the path of sinners, nor sits in the seat of the scornful;  
> But his **delight is in the law *[(teachings)](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/8451.htm)* of the LORD**, and **in His law *[(teachings)](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/8451.htm)* he meditates day and night**. 
>
> -- Psalm 1:1-2 (NKJV)

God personally said to Job that we should "depart from evil".

> Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom, and to **depart from evil** is understanding. -- Job 28:28 (NKJV)

### The armor of God

None of us is invincible. We all need to be on guard and willing to fight back for God's Kingdom.

> For we **do not wrestle against flesh and blood**, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places.
>
> Therefore take up [the whole armor of God](/content/kingdom/life/armor.md), that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.
>
> -- Ephesians 6:12-13 (NKJV)

The "armor of God" is:

1. [truth](/content/kingdom/bible/metaphors/light.md): Guard your [reputation](/content/kingdom/bible/concepts/name.md) by speaking the truth (2 Corinthians 6:7)
2. [righteousness](/content/kingdom/bible/concepts/righteousness.md): Guard your heart against [idols](/content/kingdom/bible/concepts/idolatry.md) by [loving God instead](/content/kingdom/eternal/saved/love.md) (1 Thessalonians 5:8; 2 Corinthians 6:6)
3. [the good news](/content/kingdom/bible/concepts/testimony.md): [Spread the revelation of God's Kingdom](/content/kingdom/bible/concepts/testimony.md)
4. [faith/trust](/content/kingdom/life/faith.md): [Trust God](/content/kingdom/bible/concepts/faith.md) when under attack in difficult times
5. [salvation](/content/kingdom/bible/concepts/salvation.md): Guard your mind against temptations, [sin](/content/kingdom/bible/concepts/sin.md) and condemnation (1 Thessalonians 5:8-9; Romans 12:2)
6. [word of God](/content/kingdom/bible/concepts/word.md): Obey God's word (1 John 2:3-6)
7. [prayer & supplication](/content/kingdom/life/prayer.md): Persevere by earnestly and [humbly](/content/kingdom/bible/concepts/humility.md) praying for all the saints (Romans 12:12)

### The Importance of Prayer

> **Watch and pray**, **lest you enter into temptation**. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. -- Matthew 26:41 (NKJV)

And Jesus taught his disciples to pray:

> In this manner, therefore, pray:
>
> Our Father in heaven, Hallowed be **Your name _[(authority)](/content/kingdom/bible/concepts/name.md)_**.
>
> **Your kingdom come. Your will be done** on earth as it is in heaven.
>
> **Give us this day our daily bread**.
>
> And forgive us our debts,
> As we forgive our debtors.
>
> And **do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one**.
>
> **For Yours** is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever.
>
> Amen.
>
> -- Matthew 6:9-13 (NKJV)

Jesus' first recorded sermon was about fighting for God's Kingdom so that His "kingdom come" and His "will be done". You were not called to live a comfortable life, but you were called to honor "Our Father" in obedience. 

In contrast, "the evil one" tempts you to do things according to his will:

- Instead of doubting God's protection, submit to "Your will be done"
- Instead of doubting God's provision, ask for "your daily bread"
- Instead of doubting God's authority, ask God to forgive you
- Instead of being bitter towards offenders, forgive your "debtors"
- Instead of being proud, glorify: "**For Yours** is the kingdom and the power and the glory".

Paul also advises:

> **Be anxious for nothing**, but in everything **by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God**; and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will **guard your hearts and minds** through Christ Jesus. -- Philippians 4:6-7 (NKJV)

### The Importance of the Kingdom of God

When you doubt God and try to handle things yourself, Jesus advises:

> **Seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness**, and all these things shall be added to you. Therefore **do not worry** about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about its own things. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble. -- Matthew 6:34 (NKJV)

That is why Jesus' first recorded sermon was "preaching [the gospel of the kingdom](/content/kingdom/kingdom.md)" (Matthew 4:23 NKJV)

### Eternal life through obedience

We need to obey God according to Jesus's word (John 14:23-24) and be taught by the Holy Spirit (John 14:26) so that we can live in union with the Father and Jesus (John 14:20) as Jesus repeatedly taught in John 14, confirmed with the parable of the vine in John 15, explained in John 16 and prayed in John 17.

Where Adam's **disobedience** brought death (Romans 5:12), Christ's **obedience** brings life (Romans 5:17). Paul explains the choice before us:

> Do you not know that to whom you present yourselves slaves to obey, **you are that one’s slaves whom you obey**, whether 
> * of sin leading to death, or 
> * of obedience leading to righteousness? 
>
> But God be thanked that though you were slaves of sin, yet you obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine to which you were delivered. And having been set **free from sin**, you became slaves of **righteousness**. 
>
> I speak in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh. For just as you presented your members as **slaves of uncleanness**, and of **lawlessness leading to more lawlessness**, so now present your members as slaves of righteousness for holiness. For when you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness. 
> 
> What fruit did you have then in the things of which you are now ashamed? 
> 
> For the end of those things is death. But now having been set **free from sin**, and having become slaves of God, you have your fruit to holiness, and the end, everlasting life. For **the wages of sin is death**, but **the gift of God is eternal life** in Christ Jesus our Lord.
>
> -- Romans 6:16-23 (NKJV)

James summarized [the devil's strategy](#how-the-devil-rules):

> 1. Each one is **tempted** when he is drawn away by his own **desires and enticed**. 
> 2. Then, when desire has conceived, it gives birth to **sin**;
> 3. and **sin**, when it is full-grown, brings forth **death**.
>
> -- James 1:14-15 (NKJV)

Then James, provide 5 practical defenses against sin:

#### 1. Addressing Discontentment

Instead of focusing on what you lack, focus on "every perfect gift from the Father" (James 1:16-18).

Habakkuk shows you can choose to focus on your lack or choose to rejoice in God:

> Though the fig tree may not blossom, nor fruit be on the vines;  
> Though the labor of the olive may fail, and the fields yield no food;  
> Though the flock may be cut off from the fold, and there be no herd in the stalls 
> —
> Yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my salvation.
>
> -- Habakkuk 3:17-18 (NKJV)

Moses even commanded:

> When you have eaten and are full, then you shall bless the Lord your God for the good land which He has given you. -- Deuteronomy 8:10 (NKJV)

#### 2. Addressing Wrath

Instead of focusing on retaliation, stay calm and focus on understanding the offender's view in "meekness" to resolve the conflict (James 1:19-21).

The book of Proverbs contains many wise sayings like:

> A **soft answer** turns away wrath, but a **harsh word** stirs up anger. -- Proverbs 15:1 (NKJV)

> He who is **slow to anger** is better than the mighty, and he who **rules his spirit** than he who takes a city. -- Proverbs 16:32 (NKJV)

> The **discretion** of a man makes him **slow to anger**, and his glory is to **overlook a transgression**. -- Proverbs 19:11 (NKJV)

The reason you usually want to retaliate is because you either doubt God's judgment or become impatient with His judgment:

> Cease from anger, and forsake wrath; **Do not fret — it only causes harm**.
> For evildoers shall be cut off, but **those who wait** on the LORD, they shall inherit the earth.
>
> -- Psalm 37:8-9 (NKJV)

#### 3. Addressing Slothfulness

Instead of being slothful, be a "doer of the word" because God "blesses" obedience (James 1:22-25).

Slothfulness is condemned by multiple proverbs like Proverbs 10:4, 12:24, 13:4, 15:19, 18:9, 19:15 and Ecclesiastes 10:18 and so forth.

Slothfulness is caused by:
* hoplessness - a form of discontentment (Proverbs 21:25–26)
* fear of failure (Proverbs 22:13; Ecclesiastes 11:4)
* self-deception - a form of pride (Proverbs 26:16) which may include
  * lack of dicipline (Proverbs 6:6-11, 20:13, 24:30-34)
  * avoiding discomfort (Proverbs 20:4, 21:17, 26:13-16)

#### 4. Addressing Pride

Instead of being proud, seek your reward by serving the weak (James 1:26-27)

> A haughty look, a proud heart, and the plowing of the wicked **are sin**. -- Proverbs 21:4 (NKJV)

Moses commands:

> Beware that you **do not forget** the LORD your God by not keeping His commandments, His judgments, and His statutes which I command you today, lest — 
>
> when you have eaten and are full, and have built beautiful houses and dwell in them; and when your herds and your flocks multiply, and your silver and your gold are multiplied, and all that you have is multiplied; when your heart is lifted up, and **you forget the LORD your God** Who brought you out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage; Who led you through that great and terrible wilderness, in which were fiery serpents and scorpions and thirsty land where there was no water; Who brought water for you out of the flinty rock; Who fed you in the wilderness with manna, which your fathers did not know, that **He might humble you** and that **He might test you**, to do you good in the end — then **you say in your heart**, 
>
>> ‘My power and the might of my hand have gained me this wealth.’
>
> “And **you shall remember** the LORD your God, for it is He Who gives you power to get wealth, that He may establish His covenant which He swore to your fathers, as it is this day. 
>
> Then it shall be, if you **by any means forget** the LORD your God, and follow other gods, and serve them and worship them, I testify against you this day that **you shall surely perish**.
>
> -- Deuteronomy 8:11-19 (NKJV)

Peter advised:

> **Humble yourselves**, therefore, under the mighty hand of God so that at the proper time He may exalt you, **casting all your anxieties on Him**, because He cares for you.
>
> **Be sober-minded; be watchful**. Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour. **Resist him**, **firm in your faith [*(trust in God)*](/content/kingdom/life/faith.md)**, knowing that the same kinds of suffering are being experienced by your brotherhood throughout the world. And after you have suffered a little while, the God of all grace, Who has called you to his eternal glory in Christ, will Himself restore, confirm, strengthen, and establish you. 
>
> To Him be the dominion forever and ever. Amen.
>
> -- 1 Peter 5:6-11 (ESV)

#### 5. Addressing Partiality

Instead of favoring the rich, be impartial (James 2:1-11).

> If you show partiality, **you commit sin**, and are convicted by the law as transgressors. -- James 2:9 (NKJV)

### Accountability

The kingdom of God is not a Jesus fan-club for convenience. It's a place where you are accountable to God and to one another.

> “If your brother sins against you:
> 1. go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother. 
> 2. But if he does not listen, take one or two others along with you, that every charge may be established by the evidence of two or three witnesses. 
> 3. If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church. 
>
> And if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector. 
>
> Truly, I say to you, whatever **you** bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever **you** loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. Again I say to you, if two of **you agree** on earth about anything they ask, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven. For where two or three are gathered in my *name ([authority](/content/kingdom/bible/concepts/name.md))*, there am I [among](https://biblehub.com/greek/3319.htm) them.”
>
> Then Peter came up and said to him, “Lord, how often will my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? As many as seven times?”   
> Jesus said to him, “I do not say to you seven times, but seventy-seven times. Therefore the kingdom of heaven may be compared to...”
>
> -- Matthew 18:15-23 (ESV)

Then Jesus tells the parable of the servant who refused to forgive his debtor as a warning of how important it is to forgive others. Therefore, you need to intercede ("bind on earth" and "bind in heaven") for those who sin against you, instead of condemning them.

The kingdom of God advances in the light of community and accountability. When you walk in the light together, you expose darkness not to shame, but to heal and restore.

## The Kingdom of God

> He who **dwells in the shelter of the Most High will abide in the shadow of the Almighty**. I will say to the LORD, “My refuge and my fortress, my God, **in whom I trust**.” -- Psalm 91:1-2 (ESV)

and this is how God respond:

> “Because he holds fast to Me in love,
> 1. I will **deliver** him;
> 2. I will **protect** him, because he knows My [name](/content/kingdom/god/name.md).
> 3. When he calls to me, **I will answer** him;
> 4. I will **be with him** in trouble;
> 5. I will **rescue him** and honor him.
> 6. With **long life** I will satisfy him and
> 7. **show him** My salvation.”
>

In contrast to those who live in darkness, Paul wrote:

> To the saints and faithful brothers *[in (with)](/content/kingdom/bible/translations/differences/en.md)* Christ at Colossae...
>
> And so, from the day we heard, we have not ceased to pray for you, asking that
> * you may be **filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding**,
> * so as to walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing to him, **bearing fruit in every good work** and
> * **increasing in the knowledge of God**.
> * May you **be strengthened with all power**, according to His glorious might,
> * for all **endurance and patience with joy**,
> * giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to **share in the inheritance of the saints in light**.
> * He has **delivered us from the domain of darkness** and
> * **transferred us to the kingdom of His beloved son**,

Jesus very first and most important teaching was:

> He *(Jesus)* went throughout all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming **the gospel of the kingdom** and healing every disease and every affliction among the people. 
>
> So his fame spread throughout all Syria, and they brought him all the sick, those afflicted with various diseases and pains, those oppressed by demons, those having seizures, and paralytics, and he healed them. And great crowds followed him from Galilee and the Decapolis, and from Jerusalem and Judea, and from beyond the Jordan. -- Matthew 4:23-25 (ESV)
