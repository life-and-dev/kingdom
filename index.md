# Kingdom of God

Also known as "the Kingdom of Heaven" according to Matthew.

I used to think the "Kingdom of Heaven" is *[heaven](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/idioms)*, a Greek mythological place where the gods look down onto the mortals on the earth. After all that is how it was always described in children's bible stories, cartoons and even some Christian movies. However, when I read Jesus' words, I noticed that he described a different type of kingdom.

This made me ask many questions like:

## Where is the Kingdom of God?

It is not a physical territory:

> Being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, he *(Jesus)* answered them, “**The kingdom of God is not coming in ways that can be observed**, nor will they say, ‘Look, here it is!’ or ‘There!’ for behold, the kingdom of God is in the midst of you.” — Luke 17:20-21 (ESV)

It spans across multiple realms:

> Your kingdom come, Your will be done, on **earth as it is in heaven**. — Matthew 6:10 (ESV)

## Why do we need the Kingdom of God?

In the beginning, God created humanity with a specific purpose:

> Then God said, “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and **let them have dominion** over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.” **So God created man in His own image**, in the image of God He created him;
male and female he created them. And God blessed them. And God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply and **fill the earth and subdue it, and have dominion** over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on the earth.” — Genesis 1:26-28 (ESV)

and

> The LORD God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden **to work it and keep it.** — Genesis 2:15 (ESV)

[Eden means "delight"](https://biblehub.com/hebrew/5731.htm) and was a perfect environment created by God for Adam and Eve to live in harmony with Him and creation. In a sense, Eden was the original version of the Kingdom of God.

### What Adam Lost

Adam used to enjoy:
- **Dominion over creation** (authority to rule under God) (Genesis 1:26-28; Psalm 8:6)
- **Peace and harmony** (Genesis 2:9)
- **Eternal life** (Genesis 2:9)
- **God's presence** (walking with God in the garden - Genesis 3:8)

This was the Kingdom of God: Humans willingly ruling creation under God's authority in His presence and provision to expand and maintain it.

However, because of Adam's disobedience,

> The LORD God said, “Behold, the man has become like one of us in **knowing** good and **evil**. Now, lest he reach out his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat, and live forever⁠—” therefore **the LORD God sent him out from the garden of Eden** to work the ground from which he was taken. **He drove out the man**... — Genesis 3:22-24 (ESV)

Adam forfeited:
- **Dominion over creation** (work all days on cursed ground) (Genesis 3:17-19)
- **Peace and harmony** (pain, thorns and sweat) (Genesis 3:17-19)
- **Eternal life** (death) (Genesis 2:17; Romans 5:12)
- **God's presence** (hiding in fear, expelled from the garden) (Genesis 3:8-10,23-24)

Adam was supposed to be the lord of Eden, ruling creation under God's authority, but failed.

### What Jesus Restored

> ... giving thanks to the Father, Who has **qualified you to share in the inheritance** of [the saints in light](light.md). He has delivered us from the domain of darkness and **transferred us to the kingdom of His beloved Son**, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins. — Colossians 1:12-14 (ESV)

Jesus restored (Romans 5:12-19):

- **Dominion over creation** (all authority was given to Jesus, but followers may share it) (Matthew 28:18; Phillippians 2:9-11; Luke 10:19; Romans 8:17; Ephesians 2:6)
- **Peace and harmony** (righteouness, peace, joy in the Holy Spirit) (John 14:27; Romans 5:1, 14:17; Philippians 4:7)
- **Eternal life** (John 3:16, 10:28, 11:25-26; Romans 6:23; 1 Corinthians 15:22; 1 John 5:11-12; Revelation 22:2,14)
- **God's presence** (John 14:23; 2 Corinthians 6:16; Revelation 21:3)

The Kingdom of God is God's rule/reign restored in human hearts, His presence with His people. Jesus came to restore what Adam lost.

### Who qualifies for the Kingdom of God?

> * Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life.
> * Whoever does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.
>
> — John 3:36 (ESV)

and

> Then the King will say to those on his right, "Come, you who are blessed by my Father, **inherit the kingdom prepared for you** from the foundation of the world." — Matthew 25:34 (ESV)

Paul taught:

> And we know that for those who love God **all things work together for good**, for those who are called according to his purpose. — Romans 8:28 (ESV)

and

> To the saints and faithful brothers *[in (with)](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/translations/differences/en)* Christ at Colossae...
>
> And so, from the day we heard, we have not ceased to pray for you, asking that
> * you may be **filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding**,
> * so as to walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing to him, **bearing fruit in every good work** and
> * **increasing in the knowledge of God**.
> * May you **be strengthened with all power**, according to His glorious might,
> * for all **endurance and patience with joy**,
> * giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to **share in the inheritance of the saints in light**.
> * He has **delivered us from the domain of darkness** and
> * **transferred us to the kingdom of His beloved son**,
> * in whom **we have redemption**, the forgiveness of sins. — Colossians 1:2,11-14 (ESV)

In short, it is privilege to be able to "dwell" with the trustworthy Almighty God:

> He who **dwells in the shelter of the Most High will abide in the shadow of the Almighty**. I will say to the LORD, “My refuge and my fortress, my God, **in whom I trust**.” — Psalm 91:1-2 (ESV)

and this is how God respond:

> “Because he holds fast to Me in love,
> 1. I will **deliver** him;
> 2. I will **protect** him, because he knows My [name](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/name).
> 3. When he calls to me, **I will answer** him;
> 4. I will **be with him** in trouble;
> 5. I will **rescue him** and honor him.
> 6. With **long life** I will satisfy him and
> 7. **show him** My salvation.”
>
> — Psalm 91:14-16 (ESV)

## Who is part of the Kingdom of God?

Jesus very first teaching recorded by Matthew 5-7, was about "the Kingdom of Heaven" and he opens with the statement:

> Blessed are [the poor in spirit](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/idioms#poor-in-the-spirit): **for theirs is the kingdom of heaven**. — Matthew 5:3 (ESV)

This is perhaps a reference to:

> In just a little while, the wicked will be no more;    
> though you look carefully at his place, he will not be there.    
> But **the *meek (humble/lowly/poor)* shall inherit the land and delight themselves in abundant peace**.
>
> — Psalm 37:10 (ESV)

Jesus taught his disciples what kind of humility is required:

> At that time the disciples came to Jesus, saying, “Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?” 
>
> And calling to him a child, he put him in the midst of them and said, “Truly, I say to you, unless you turn and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. Whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
>
> — Matthew 18:1-4 (ESV)

And then James also warned:

> You adulterous people!
> Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God?
>
> Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.
>
> Or do you suppose it is to no purpose that the Scripture says, “He yearns jealously over the spirit that he has made to dwell in us”?
>
> But He gives more grace. Therefore it says,
>
>> “God opposes the proud, but gives **grace to the humble**.”
>
> * Submit yourselves therefore to God.
> * Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
> * Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you.
> * Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded.
> * Be wretched and mourn and weep.
> * Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom.
>
> **Humble yourselves before the Lord**, and he will exalt you.
>
> — James 4:4-10 (ESV)

"Poor in spirit" or "the meek" could also refer to those who are convicted of their sin and willing to repent. For example:

> Now when they heard this **they were cut to the heart**, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, “Brothers, what shall we do?”
>
> And Peter said to them, “[Repent](https://eternal.family.net.za/eternal/saved/repent) and [be baptized](https://eternal.family.net.za/eternal/saved/baptize) every one of you in [the name](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/name) of [Jesus](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son) [Christ](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/christ) for the forgiveness of your [sins](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/sin), and you will receive [the gift](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/spirit/gifts) of [the Holy Spirit](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/spirit). For [the promise](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/covenants/christ) is for you and for your children and for all who are far off, everyone whom [the Lord](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/father/name#lord) our [God](https://eternal.family.net.za/god) calls to himself.”
>
> And with many other words he bore witness and continued to exhort them, saying, [“Save yourselves from this crooked generation.”](https://eternal.family.net.za/eternal/saved)
>
> So those who received his word were baptized, and there were **added that day about three thousand souls**.
>
> — Acts 2:37-41 (ESV)

## Who is not part of the Kingdom of God?

Paul provided clear warnings about who will be excluded:

> Now the works of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, divisions, envy, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these. I warn you, as I warned you before, that **those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God**. — Galatians 5:19-21 (ESV); 1 Corinthians 6:9-10

But Jesus even set a higher standard:

> When [the Son of Man](https://son.ofgod.info/son-of-man) comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne. 
> 
> Before him will be gathered all the nations, and he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. And he will place the sheep on his right, but the goats on the left. 
> 
> Then the king will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. For 
> * I was hungry and you gave me food, 
> * I was thirsty and you gave me drink, 
> * I was a stranger and you welcomed me, 
> * I was naked and you clothed me, 
> * I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me.’ 
>
> Then the righteous will answer him, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink? And when did we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you? And when did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?’ 
> 
> And the king will answer them, ‘Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these [my brothers](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/family), you did it to me.’
> 
> “Then he will say to those on his left, ‘Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. For 
> * I was hungry and you gave me no food, 
> * I was thirsty and you gave me no drink, 
> * I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, 
> * *[I was]* naked and you did not clothe me, 
> * *[I was]* sick and in prison and you did not visit me.’
>
> Then they also will answer, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to you?’ 
> 
> Then he will answer them, saying, ‘Truly, I say to you, as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to me.’ 
> 
> And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.”
>
> — Matthew 25:31-46 (ESV)

## Who rules over the Kingdom of God?

> **The LORD ([YHVH](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/name#yhvh)) has established his throne in the heavens, and His kingdom rules over all.**
>
> Bless the LORD, O you His angels, you mighty ones who do His word, obeying the voice of His word!  
> Bless the LORD, all His hosts, His ministers, who do His will!  
> Bless the LORD, all His works, in all places of His dominion.  
> Bless the LORD, O my soul!
>
> — Psalm 103:19-22 (ESV)

However, many centuries later, Jesus claim that he received all authority from God:

> And Jesus came and said to them, “**All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.**” — Matthew 28:18 (ESV)

and

> All things have been handed over to me by my Father... — Luke 10:22 (ESV)

and

> The Father loves the Son and has given all things into his hand. — John 3:35 (ESV)

Paul also wrote:

> I do not cease to give thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers, that **the God of our Lord Jesus Christ**, the Father of glory, may give you the Spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of Him, having the eyes of your hearts enlightened, that you may know what is the hope to which He has called you, what are the riches of His glorious inheritance in the saints, and what is the immeasurable greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the working of His great might that He worked in Christ when
> 1. He raised him from the dead and
> 2. seated him at His right hand in the heavenly places, far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and above every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the one to come.
> 3. And He put all things under his feet and gave him as head over all things to the church, which is [his body](christ/body.md), the fullness of Him who fills all in all. — Ephesians 1:16-23 (ESV)

According to Paul, Jesus did not replace God, but instead that Jesus acts as a delegate under the authority of his God. (1 Corinthians 3:23, 11:3)

> Now when all things are made subject to him, then **the Son himself will also be subject to Him** who put all things under him, that God may be all in all. — 1 Corinthians 15:28 (NKJV)

## When is the Kingdom of God?

> Now after John was arrested, Jesus came into Galilee, proclaiming the gospel of God, and saying, “**The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand** *[near or has approached]*; [repent](https://eternal.family.net.za/eternal/saved/repent) and [believe in the gospel](https://eternal.family.net.za/eternal/saved/belief).” — Mark 1:14 (ESV)

## What is the Kingdom of God?

> Why do you pass judgment on your brother?   
> Or you, why do you despise your brother?
>
> For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God;
>
> for it is written,
>
>> “As I live, says [the LORD](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/father/name#lord), every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.” — Isaiah 45:23
>
> So then [each of us will give an account of himself to God](https://eternal.family.net.za/eternal/judgement).
>
> Therefore let us not pass judgment on one another any longer, but rather decide never to put a stumbling block or hindrance in the way of a brother. I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself, but it is unclean for anyone who thinks it unclean. For if your brother is grieved by what you eat, you are no longer walking in love. By what you eat, do not destroy the one for whom Christ died. So do not let what you regard as good be spoken of as evil.
>
> For **the kingdom of God** is not a matter of eating and drinking but of **righteousness and peace and joy** *[in [by]](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/translations/differences/en)* the Holy Spirit.
>
> Whoever thus serves [Christ](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/son/christ) is **acceptable to God** and approved by men. So then let us pursue what makes for **peace and for mutual upbuilding**.
>
> — Romans 14:10-19 (ESV)

Jesus explains the Kingdom of God with parables (Matthew 13:10-17; Mark 4:10-12).

### The parable of the wedding invitation

> And again Jesus spoke to them in parables, saying, 
> 
> “**The kingdom of heaven** may be compared to a king who gave a wedding feast for his son, and sent his servants to call those who were invited to the wedding feast, but they would not come. 
> 
> Again he sent other servants, saying, ‘Tell those who are invited, “See, I have prepared my dinner, my oxen and my fat calves have been slaughtered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding feast.”’ 
> 
> But they paid no attention and went off, one to his farm, another to his business, while the rest seized his servants, treated them shamefully, and killed them. 
> 
> The king was angry, and he sent his troops and destroyed those murderers and burned their city. 
> 
> Then he said to his servants, ‘The wedding feast is ready, but those invited were not worthy. Go therefore to the main roads and invite to the wedding feast as many as you find.’ 
> 
> And those servants went out into the roads and gathered all whom they found, both bad and good. So the wedding hall was filled with guests.
> 
> But when the king came in to look at the guests, he saw there a man who had no wedding garment. 
> 
> And he said to him, ‘Friend, how did you get in here without a wedding garment?’  
> And he was speechless.  
> Then the king said to the attendants, ‘Bind him hand and foot and cast him into the outer darkness’. 
> 
> In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. For many are called, but few are chosen.” 
> 
> — Matthew 22:1-14 (ESV)

Explanation:

1. God the Father ([YHVH](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/name#yhvh)) originally chosen Israel to be His nation.
2. The Father's invitation is [the Gospel of Salvation](https://eternal.family.net.za/eternal/saved) which leads people to [repentance](https://eternal.family.net.za/eternal/saved/repent) so that they could live in [righteousness with God](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/righteousness). 
3. The purpose of the Gospel to prepare a people group to serve His Son.
4. This was initially proclaimed by God's servants like John the Baptist, but he was persecuted for doing so.
5. The scribes and pharisees stirred up the Jews to persecute God's servants in Jerusalem, therefore Jerusalem were condemned.
6. This persecution caused the Gospel to spread to foreign non-Jewish regions like the Greek and Roman territories who known by the Jews as the "gentiles" which were previously not considered "worthy" of the Gospel according to the Jews.
7. The "faithful servants" are the disciples who trusted God by risking their lives to spread the Gospel and who stayed faithful in the face of persecution.
8. The "wicked servants" are those who dishonor God's Son, the Christ. They often consider themselves ["Christians"](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/christian) but refuse to obey Christ who is supposed to be their Lord. This pride dishonors the Son of God like the man with the wrong wedding garment.
9. Jesus also warned that God will judge all "guests" and that the "wicked" will be cast into "outer darkness" which is a place of "weeping and gnashing of teeth".

When the almighty God of the universe invite guests to His son's special occasion, He expects them to be:
    * to be ready on time (see other parables)
    * clean (of sin)
    * with the proper garment (to honor His son)
    * to live in "[righteousness](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/righteousness), peace and joy" with the other attendees which is God Himself, His son and the other guests

Only these will be "chosen" for "the wedding feast". In other words, God, the Father will selectively reward (Matthew 5:44-6:20) those who honored His invitation.

Earlier in the same book, Matthew recorded Jesus first teaching:

> Blessed are the [poor in spirit](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/idioms#poor-in-the-spirit), for [theirs is **the kingdom of heaven**](#who-is-part-of-the-kingdom-of-god).  
> Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.  
> Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.  
> Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.  
> Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy.  
> Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.  
> Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called [sons of God](https://eternal.family.net.za/god/sons-of-god).  
>
> — Matthew 5:3-9 (ESV)

God's children are humble, genuine, merciful, pure and be peacemakers. Someone cannot be a "son of God", but not be part of God's kingdom.

But then Jesus warns:

> Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is **the kingdom of heaven**.  
> Blessed are you when others revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account.
>
> Rejoice and be glad, for **your reward is great in [heaven](https://eternal.family.net.za/bible/concepts/heaven)**, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.
>
> — Matthew 5:3-12 (ESV)

As explained by the above parable, those who are serving God's kingdom will be "persecuted" by the world.  But then Jesus also warned that the persecution should be "for righteousness' sake" and not because we lost our ability to "preserve" the Jesus' gospel: 

> "You are the salt of the earth, but if salt has lost its taste, how shall its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything except to be **thrown out and trampled under people's feet**." — Matthew 5:13 (ESV)

Our goal should not be to get persecuted, but to be effective on Earth.

Then Jesus explains with the parable...

## Your Place in God's Kingdom

Now you've seen what Jesus taught about the Kingdom of God. You've read the parables, the warnings, and the promises. Here's what you need to ask yourself: Are you actually living as a citizen of God's kingdom, or are you just a member of a religious club?

You cannot serve two masters. You cannot claim to follow Christ while ignoring His commands. You cannot expect to inherit the kingdom while living for yourself. The difference between the "faithful servant" and the "wicked servant" in Jesus' parable isn't their initial position. It's what they did with what they were given.

> Jesus answered him, “Truly, truly, I say to you, **unless one is born again** he cannot see the kingdom of God.”  
> Nicodemus said to him, “How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother’s womb and be born?”  
> Jesus answered, “Truly, truly, I say to you, **unless one is born of water and the Spirit**, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Do not marvel that I said to you, **‘You must be born again.’** The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear its sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.”

In other words, [the Spirit](https://ofgod.info) leads those who are born again so that they can see the Kingdom of God.

God has given you everything you need. You have the Holy Spirit if you've truly believed and repented. You have access to His Word. You have brothers and sisters in Christ. You have a mission: to bear fruit, to serve others, to spread the Gospel, to live in righteousness.

So what will you do with what God has entrusted to you? Will you be found faithful when the Master returns, or are you just hearing His words and walking away unchanged?

The Kingdom of God is not something you can observe from a distance. It requires your participation, your obedience, your whole life. Will you enter through the narrow gate, or will you continue on the wide path that leads to destruction?

The choice is yours. But choose wisely, because the King is coming at an hour you do not expect.
