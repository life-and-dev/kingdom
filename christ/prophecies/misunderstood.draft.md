Prophecies that are misunderstood or confused with Jesus.

| Scripture       | Assumption                                          | Truth                                        |

| Hosea 11:1      | Jesus would be released from Egypt.                 | Israel is mistaken for Jesus.                |
| Jeremiah 23:5-6 | Jesus will save Judah and make Israel dwell safely. | This never happened. Perhaps a future event? |
