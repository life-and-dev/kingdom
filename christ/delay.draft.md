# Why Did God Wait Thousands of Years?

If the Kingdom was God's plan, why wait [approximately 4000 years](https://www.lindahall.org/about/news/scientist-of-the-day/james-ussher) from Adam to Jesus?

**Because all human systems had to fail first.**

From Adam to Christ, humanity tried every conceivable form of governance:

1. **Family/Tribal Governance (Adam to Noah)**: Humans living by their own wisdom
   - Result: "The LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great... every intention... was only evil continually" (Genesis 6:5)
   - Conclusion: **Failed**

2. **Law (Moses)**: God's perfect law given to guide behavior
   - Result: Golden calf immediately (Exodus 32), constant rebellion
   - Paul's conclusion: "For God has done what **the law, weakened by the flesh, could not do**" (Romans 8:3)
   - Conclusion: **Failed** (law reveals sin but cannot save)

3. **Judges**: God raised up deliverers to lead Israel
   - Result: "Everyone did what was right in his own eyes" (Judges 21:25)
   - Constant cycles of sin, oppression, deliverance, sin again
   - Conclusion: **Failed**

4. **Kings**: Human monarchs ruling God's people
   - Result: Kingdom divided, idolatry, exile
   - Even the best kings (David, Solomon) committed serious sins (2 Samuel 11; 1 Kings 11)
   - Conclusion: **Failed**

5. **Empires** (Babylon, Persia, Greece, Rome): World powers governing nations
   - Result: All rose and fell, all oppressive, all temporary (Daniel 2 illustrates succession of empires)
   - Daniel's vision (Daniel 2): God's Kingdom will crush human empires
   - Conclusion: **Failed**

By the time Jesus arrived, **every human system had been exhausted**. Humanity had proven utterly incapable of self-governance. The 4000-year test demonstrated humanity's absolute need for God's Kingdom, ruled by a worthy human King.

> "But when the **fullness of time** had come, God sent forth his Son, born of woman, born under the law." (Galatians 4:4)

The "fullness of time" = when the test was complete, when no one could say "but we haven't tried this yet."
