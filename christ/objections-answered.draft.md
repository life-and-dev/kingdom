# Addressing Objections About Jesus as Messiah

## Introduction: Questions Deserve Answers

If Jesus truly is the promised Messiah, then legitimate questions should have satisfactory answers. Honest skepticism isn't the enemy of faith—it's the pathway to deeper understanding.

This article addresses common objections to Jesus as the Messiah, including:

- **Unfulfilled Prophecies**: "Messiah was supposed to bring political peace, rebuild the temple, and regather Israel—but none of this happened in Jesus' lifetime"
- **Contextual Concerns**: "Some prophecies don't seem to be about an individual Messiah"
- **Theological Questions**: "If Jesus is the Messiah, why did most Jewish leaders reject him?"
- **Islamic Perspective**: "We honor Jesus as a prophet—why believe more?"

Additionally, we'll explore what Jesus revealed about God that goes beyond Old Testament expectations—truths not explicitly stated in Hebrew Scripture but consistent with it.

**Approach:**

This isn't about dismissing objections or offering pat answers. Each concern is addressed thoughtfully, with biblical evidence and logical reasoning. The goal is understanding, not winning arguments.

Truth can withstand scrutiny. Let's examine these questions honestly.

# Part 1: Unfulfilled Prophecies and the Two-Comings Model

## The Core Objection

**Jewish Expectation:**
Many Jewish scholars expected the Messiah to:
- Defeat Israel's enemies and establish political sovereignty
- Rebuild the temple destroyed by Babylon
- Regather all Jewish exiles to the land of Israel
- Bring universal peace and justice
- End all warfare

**The Problem:**
Jesus didn't do these things during his earthly ministry. Rome continued ruling. The temple stood but was later destroyed (70 AD). Jewish people remained scattered. Wars continued.

**The Question:**
If Jesus is the Messiah, why didn't he fulfill these prophecies?

## The Two-Comings Model: Suffering Servant and Conquering King

### What the Old Testament Actually Revealed

When examined carefully, the Hebrew Bible presents **two distinct portraits** of the Messiah that appear contradictory:

**Portrait 1: The Suffering Servant**
- Despised and rejected (Isaiah 53:3)
- Silent before accusers (Isaiah 53:7)
- Pierced for our transgressions (Isaiah 53:5)
- Numbered with transgressors (Isaiah 53:12)
- Cut off from the land of the living (Isaiah 53:8)
- Makes his soul an offering for guilt (Isaiah 53:10)

**Portrait 2: The Conquering King**
- Breaks enemies like pottery (Psalm 2:9)
- Given dominion over all nations (Daniel 7:13-14)
- Destroys the wicked with the breath of his lips (Isaiah 11:4)
- Establishes everlasting kingdom (Isaiah 9:7)
- Brings universal peace (Isaiah 9:6-7)
- Judges all nations (Isaiah 2:4)

**The Ancient Puzzle:**

How can the Messiah be *both*?
- Rejected yet exalted?
- Killed yet reigning forever?
- Suffering yet victorious?

Ancient Jewish scholars debated this. Some proposed **two different Messiahs**:
- **Messiah ben Joseph** (son of Joseph)—a suffering, dying Messiah
- **Messiah ben David** (son of David)—a conquering, reigning king

But the New Testament presents a different solution: **One Messiah, two comings**.

---

### First Coming: Suffering Servant

Jesus fulfilled the *suffering servant* prophecies in his first advent:

✓ Born in Bethlehem (Micah 5:2)
✓ Rejected by his people (Isaiah 53:3; John 1:11)
✓ Silent before accusers (Isaiah 53:7; Matthew 27:12-14)
✓ Pierced hands and feet (Psalm 22:16; John 19:34, 20:27)
✓ Crucified with criminals (Isaiah 53:12; Luke 23:32-33)
✓ Made his soul an offering for sin (Isaiah 53:10; 2 Corinthians 5:21)
✓ Raised from the dead (Psalm 16:10; Acts 2:31-32)
✓ Ascended to God's right hand (Psalm 110:1; Mark 16:19)

**Purpose of First Coming:**
Not political deliverance, but **spiritual reconciliation**—dealing with humanity's sin problem before establishing the eternal kingdom.

> For the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and **to give his life as a ransom for many**. — Mark 10:45 (ESV)

---

### Second Coming: Conquering King

Jesus himself prophesied a **second coming** to fulfill the conquering king prophecies:

> Then will appear in heaven the sign of the Son of Man, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and **they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory**. And he will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other. — Matthew 24:30-31 (ESV)

The unfulfilled messianic prophecies await this second advent:

**Still Future:**
- Universal peace established (Isaiah 2:4; 9:6-7)
- All nations come to worship in Jerusalem (Zechariah 14:16)
- Knowledge of the LORD fills the earth (Isaiah 11:9)
- Resurrection and final judgment (Daniel 12:2)
- New heavens and new earth (Isaiah 65:17; Revelation 21:1)
- Satan defeated and bound (Revelation 20:1-3, cf. Genesis 3:15)

---

### Biblical Precedent for Two Comings

This pattern isn't unprecedented. Consider **Joseph**:

**First Appearance to Brothers:** Rejected, sold into slavery, presumed dead (Genesis 37)
**Second Appearance to Brothers:** Exalted ruler, saves them from famine, reconciliation (Genesis 45)

The brothers didn't recognize Joseph the first time. Only at the second meeting did they understand who he truly was.

Similarly:
- **First Coming**: Jesus came humbly, was rejected, crucified, buried
- **Second Coming**: Jesus will return gloriously, be recognized, reign eternally

---

### The "Already/Not Yet" Kingdom

Jesus taught that the kingdom of God has **two phases**:

**Already (Inaugurated):**
> But if it is by the Spirit of God that I cast out demons, then **the kingdom of God has come upon you**. — Matthew 12:28 (ESV)

The kingdom began with Jesus' first coming—spiritually present wherever Jesus reigns in hearts.

**Not Yet (Consummated):**
> When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, **then he will sit on his glorious throne**. Before him will be gathered all the nations, and he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. — Matthew 25:31-32 (ESV)

The kingdom will be fully realized at the second coming—physically established on earth.

This "already/not yet" tension explains apparent discrepancies:
- Peace *offered* now (John 14:27), *established globally* later (Isaiah 9:6-7)
- Kingdom *present spiritually* now (Luke 17:21), *manifest physically* later (Revelation 11:15)
- Enemies *defeated spiritually* now (Colossians 2:15), *judged physically* later (Revelation 19:11-21)

## Specific Unfulfilled Prophecies Addressed

### Jeremiah 23:5-6: Judah Saved, Israel Dwelling Safely

**Prophecy:**

> Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when I will raise up for David a righteous Branch, and he shall reign as king and deal wisely, and shall execute justice and righteousness in the land. **In his days Judah will be saved, and Israel will dwell securely**. And this is the name by which he will be called: 'The LORD is our righteousness.' — Jeremiah 23:5-6 (ESV)

**Objection:**
Israel didn't dwell safely during Jesus' lifetime. In fact, Jerusalem was destroyed by Rome in 70 AD, and Jewish people were scattered worldwide.

**Response:**

Notice the phrase "**In his days**"—referring to the *days of his reign*. Jesus' reign began at his resurrection and ascension:

> All authority in heaven and on earth **has been given to me**. — Matthew 28:18 (ESV)

But his visible, earthly reign hasn't yet begun. That awaits the second coming:

> The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and **he shall reign forever and ever**. — Revelation 11:15 (ESV)

**Fulfillment Timeline:**
- **First Coming**: Messiah identified, atonement accomplished, spiritual salvation offered
- **Church Age** (now): Gospel preached to all nations, spiritual Israel gathered
- **Second Coming**: Physical reign established, Israel regathered, universal peace

The prophecy remains valid but awaits complete fulfillment at Christ's return.

Additionally, "Israel will dwell securely" has *spiritual* dimensions fulfilled now:

> There is therefore now **no condemnation** for those who are in Christ Jesus. — Romans 8:1 (ESV)

Believers (spiritual Israel) dwell securely in God's love, safe from ultimate judgment—eternal security.

---

### Temple Not Rebuilt

**Expectation:**
Many expected the Messiah to rebuild the physical temple destroyed by Babylon (586 BC).

**What Happened:**
The temple *was* rebuilt by Zerubbabel (~516 BC) and renovated by Herod (20 BC). It stood during Jesus' lifetime but was destroyed by Rome in 70 AD. It has never been rebuilt.

**Response:**

Jesus **is** the new temple:

> Jesus answered them, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up." The Jews then said, "It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and will you raise it up in three days?" But **he was speaking about the temple of his body**. — John 2:19-21 (ESV)

The temple's purpose was to be the place where God dwells with humanity. Jesus fulfilled this:

> And the Word became flesh and **dwelt** [Greek: *eskenosen*, "tabernacled"] **among us**, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth. — John 1:14 (ESV)

God now dwells not in a building but in *people*:

> Do you not know that **you are God's temple** and that God's Spirit dwells in you? — 1 Corinthians 3:16 (ESV)

> And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, "Behold, **the dwelling place of God is with man**. He will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God." — Revelation 21:3 (ESV)

**Why No Physical Temple?**

The temple system was a *shadow* pointing to the reality: Jesus.

- **Old Temple**: Animal sacrifices, repeated daily, covering sin temporarily
- **Jesus**: Once-for-all sacrifice, removing sin permanently (Hebrews 10:10-14)

- **Old Temple**: High priest entered Most Holy Place once a year
- **Jesus**: Eternal High Priest, continual access to God (Hebrews 4:14-16)

- **Old Temple**: Veil separated people from God's presence
- **Jesus**: Veil torn at crucifixion, direct access opened (Matthew 27:51; Hebrews 10:19-20)

The physical temple became obsolete when Jesus fulfilled what it symbolized.

---

### Israel Not Regathered

**Expectation:**
Prophets predicted Israel's regathering to the land:

> Behold, I will gather them from all the countries to which I drove them in my anger and my wrath and in great indignation. **I will bring them back to this place, and I will make them dwell in safety**. — Jeremiah 32:37 (ESV)

**Objection:**
Jewish people remained scattered after Jesus' time, especially after the Roman destruction of Jerusalem (70 AD) and Bar Kokhba revolt (135 AD).

**Response:**

**1. Partial Fulfillment:**
Israel's modern restoration (1948) represents *partial* fulfillment. Jewish people have returned to the land and established a nation—unprecedented in history.

**2. Spiritual Fulfillment:**
The New Testament redefines "Israel" to include all who have faith in Messiah:

> For **not all who are descended from Israel belong to Israel**, and not all are children of Abraham because they are his offspring... This means that it is **not the children of the flesh who are the children of God, but the children of the promise** are counted as offspring. — Romans 9:6-8 (ESV)

> Know then that **it is those of faith who are the sons of Abraham**. — Galatians 3:7 (ESV)

> For **no one is a Jew who is merely one outwardly**, nor is circumcision outward and physical. But a Jew is one inwardly, and **circumcision is a matter of the heart**, by the Spirit, not by the letter. — Romans 2:28-29 (ESV)

Spiritual Israel (believers from all nations) is being "regathered" now through the gospel.

**3. Future Fulfillment:**
Paul indicates a future, large-scale turning of ethnic Israel to Jesus:

> Lest you be wise in your own sight, I do not want you to be unaware of this mystery, brothers: **a partial hardening has come upon Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in. And in this way all Israel will be saved**, as it is written, "The Deliverer will come from Zion, he will banish ungodliness from Jacob." — Romans 11:25-26 (ESV)

The complete regathering—physical and spiritual—awaits Christ's return.

---

### Universal Peace Not Established

**Prophecy:**

> He shall judge between the nations, and shall decide disputes for many peoples; and **they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war anymore**. — Isaiah 2:4 (ESV)

**Objection:**
Wars have continued for 2,000 years since Jesus. Where is the universal peace?

**Response:**

This prophecy explicitly refers to the Messiah's **reign**, which hasn't fully begun:

> For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and **the government shall be upon his shoulder**... Of the increase of his government and of peace there will be no end, on the throne of David and over his kingdom, to establish it and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness **from this time forth and forevermore**. — Isaiah 9:6-7 (ESV)

Notice: "*The government shall be upon his shoulder*"—this refers to Jesus' *ruling* authority, not just his birth.

Jesus himself taught that this age would have tribulation:

> You will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not alarmed, for this must take place, but **the end is not yet**. For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. — Matthew 24:6-7 (ESV)

Universal peace awaits his visible return:

> Then I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse! The one sitting on it is called Faithful and True, and **in righteousness he judges and makes war**... On his robe and on his thigh he has a name written, **King of kings and Lord of lords**. — Revelation 19:11, 16 (ESV)

**Already/Not Yet:**
- **Already**: Peace *with God* is available now through faith (Romans 5:1)
- **Already**: Inner peace *from God* is given to believers (John 14:27; Philippians 4:7)
- **Not Yet**: Universal, political peace on earth awaits the second coming

The absence of global peace doesn't disprove Jesus as Messiah—it confirms we're living between the two comings, exactly as Jesus predicted.

---

## The Pattern: Inaugurated vs. Consummated Fulfillment

Many messianic prophecies have **dual fulfillment**:

| Prophecy | Inaugurated (1st Coming) | Consummated (2nd Coming) |
|----------|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| Kingdom established | Spiritually present (Luke 17:21) | Physically manifest (Rev 11:15) |
| Peace | With God (Rom 5:1), inner (John 14:27) | Global, political (Isaiah 2:4) |
| Israel saved | Spiritual Israel gathered (Rom 11:17) | Ethnic Israel turns to Messiah (Rom 11:26) |
| Temple rebuilt | Jesus' body, believers (John 2:21; 1 Cor 3:16) | New Jerusalem descends (Rev 21:2-3) |
| Enemies defeated | Spiritual powers (Col 2:15) | Physical destruction (Rev 19:19-21) |
| Judgment | Separation begins (John 3:18) | Final judgment (Matt 25:31-46) |

This pattern resolves the apparent tension between fulfilled and unfulfilled prophecies.

# Part 2: What Jesus Revealed Beyond the Old Testament

## Introduction: Progressive Revelation

The Old Testament provided foundational truth, but it was incomplete. God revealed Himself progressively, with Jesus bringing the fullest revelation:

> Long ago, at many times and in many ways, God spoke to our fathers by the prophets, but **in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son**, whom he appointed the heir of all things, through whom also he created the world. — Hebrews 1:1-2 (ESV)

Jesus didn't *contradict* the Old Testament—he *fulfilled* and *clarified* it, revealing truths that were hidden or only hinted at before.

---

## 1. The Triune Nature of God (Father, Son, Holy Spirit)

### Old Testament Hints

The Hebrew Bible contains hints of God's complex nature:

**Plural Language:**
> Then God said, "Let **us** make man in **our** image, after **our** likeness." — Genesis 1:26 (ESV)

**Distinct Persons:**
- The Angel of the LORD who *is* the LORD yet is sent *by* the LORD (Genesis 16:7-13; Exodus 3:2-6)
- The Spirit of God as distinct agent (Genesis 1:2; Psalm 51:11)
- Messiah at God's right hand (Psalm 110:1)

**The Shema:**
> Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God, the LORD is **one**. — Deuteronomy 6:4 (ESV)

The Hebrew word "one" (*echad*) can mean *composite unity* (e.g., "one flesh" in marriage, Genesis 2:24).

### Jesus' Revelation

Jesus explicitly revealed the Trinity:

**1. The Father:**
> In that same hour he rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and said, "I thank you, **Father**, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to little children; yes, Father, for such was your gracious will." — Luke 10:21 (ESV)

**2. The Son:**
> I and the Father are one. — John 10:30 (ESV)

> Whoever has seen me has seen the Father. — John 14:9 (ESV)

**3. The Holy Spirit:**
> And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Helper, to be with you forever, even **the Spirit of truth**, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees him nor knows him. You know him, for he dwells with you and will be in you. — John 14:16-17 (ESV)

**Baptismal Formula (All Three):**
> Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in **the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit**. — Matthew 28:19 (ESV)

Note: "name" (singular) yet three persons—one God in three persons.

---

## 2. Grace Through Faith, Not Law-Keeping

### Old Testament Pattern

Salvation was *always* by faith, but this wasn't fully clear:

> And he [Abraham] believed the LORD, and he counted it to him as righteousness. — Genesis 15:6 (ESV)

But the law's role was ambiguous. Many understood it as the *means* of righteousness rather than the *revealer* of sin.

### Jesus' Clarification

Jesus taught that the law cannot save—it exposes need:

> Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father. **There is one who accuses you: Moses**, on whom you have set your hope. For if you believed Moses, you would believe me; for he wrote of me. — John 5:45-46 (ESV)

Paul explained:

> For **by works of the law no human being will be justified** in his sight, since **through the law comes knowledge of sin**. But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law, although the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it—**the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ** for all who believe. — Romans 3:20-22 (ESV)

**Grace Revealed:**
> For the law was given through Moses; **grace and truth came through Jesus Christ**. — John 1:17 (ESV)

The Old Testament hinted at this (Isaiah 64:6; Psalm 51:16-17), but Jesus made it explicit: salvation is by grace through faith, not human effort.

---

## 3. Love for Enemies, Not Just Neighbors

### Old Testament Standard

The law commanded love for neighbors:

> You shall not take vengeance or bear a grudge against the sons of your own people, but **you shall love your neighbor as yourself**: I am the LORD. — Leviticus 19:18 (ESV)

But enemies? The Psalms contain imprecatory prayers asking God to destroy them (Psalm 137:8-9; 139:19-22).

### Jesus' Radical Extension

> You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' But I say to you, **Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you**, so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust. — Matthew 5:43-45 (ESV)

This transcends Old Testament ethics—not contradicting it, but elevating it.

---

## 4. The Kingdom as Both Present and Future ("Already/Not Yet")

### Old Testament Expectation

The kingdom was understood as *future*, political, visible:

> The LORD will be king over all the earth. On that day the LORD will be one and his name one. — Zechariah 14:9 (ESV)

### Jesus' Teaching

**Present (Spiritual):**
> Being asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, he answered them, "The kingdom of God is not coming in ways that can be observed, nor will they say, 'Look, here it is!' or 'There!' for behold, **the kingdom of God is in the midst of you**." — Luke 17:20-21 (ESV)

**Future (Physical):**
> When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne. — Matthew 25:31 (ESV)

The kingdom exists *now* wherever Jesus reigns in hearts, and *will* be consummated when he returns visibly.

---

## 5. Indwelling Holy Spirit for All Believers

### Old Testament Pattern

The Spirit came *upon* select individuals (prophets, kings, judges) for specific tasks:
- Moses and the 70 elders (Numbers 11:25)
- David (1 Samuel 16:13)
- Prophets (2 Peter 1:21)

But the Spirit didn't permanently dwell *in* all believers.

### Jesus' Promise

> Nevertheless, I tell you the truth: it is to your advantage that I go away, for if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you. But if I go, **I will send him to you**. — John 16:7 (ESV)

**Fulfillment at Pentecost:**
> And they were **all filled with the Holy Spirit** and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance. — Acts 2:4 (ESV)

Now *all* believers receive the indwelling Spirit:

> Do you not know that you are God's temple and that **God's Spirit dwells in you**? — 1 Corinthians 3:16 (ESV)

This was partially prophesied (Joel 2:28-29), but Jesus made it reality.

---

## 6. Explicit Teaching on Resurrection and Eternal Life

### Old Testament Ambiguity

Resurrection was hinted at but not clearly taught:

> And many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt. — Daniel 12:2 (ESV)

Job expressed faith:
> For I know that my Redeemer lives, and at the last he will stand upon the earth. And after my skin has been thus destroyed, yet in my flesh I shall see God. — Job 19:25-26 (ESV)

But many Jews (like the Sadducees) didn't believe in resurrection (Matthew 22:23).

### Jesus' Clear Teaching

> Do not marvel at this, for an hour is coming when **all who are in the tombs will hear his voice and come out**, those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil to the resurrection of judgment. — John 5:28-29 (ESV)

> I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in me, **though he die, yet shall he live**, and everyone who lives and believes in me shall never die. — John 11:25-26 (ESV)

Jesus didn't just teach resurrection—he *demonstrated* it by rising from the dead.

**Eternal Life Emphasized:**
> For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but **have eternal life**. — John 3:16 (ESV)

Jesus made eternal life the central promise, clearly and repeatedly.

---

## 7. The New Covenant Explained

### Old Testament Promise

Jeremiah prophesied a "new covenant":

> Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when **I will make a new covenant** with the house of Israel and the house of Judah, not like the covenant that I made with their fathers on the day when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, my covenant that they broke... For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares the LORD: **I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts**. And I will be their God, and they shall be my people. — Jeremiah 31:31-33 (ESV)

But *how* and *when* remained unclear.

### Jesus' Fulfillment

On the night before his crucifixion:

> And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, saying, "Drink of it, all of you, for **this is my blood of the covenant**, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins." — Matthew 26:27-28 (ESV)

Luke records:
> And likewise the cup after they had eaten, saying, **"This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood."** — Luke 22:20 (ESV)

Jesus established the New Covenant through his sacrificial death, fulfilling Jeremiah's prophecy.

---

# Part 3: Other Objections Addressed

## "Why Didn't Most Jewish Leaders Accept Jesus?"

### The Question

If Jesus truly fulfilled the prophecies, why did the religious experts—the scribes, Pharisees, and priests—reject him?

### The Answer

**1. Jesus Predicted This:**

> He came to his own, and his own people did not receive him. — John 1:11 (ESV)

Isaiah prophesied:
> He was despised and rejected by men. — Isaiah 53:3 (ESV)

The rejection itself fulfilled prophecy.

**2. Spiritual Blindness:**

> And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing. In their case **the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers**, to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ. — 2 Corinthians 4:3-4 (ESV)

Paul explains Israel's temporary hardening:
> What then? Israel failed to obtain what it was seeking. The elect obtained it, but **the rest were hardened**. — Romans 11:7 (ESV)

**3. Vested Interests:**

The religious leaders had positions, power, and wealth dependent on the temple system. Jesus threatened this:

> If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away both **our place and our nation**. — John 11:48 (ESV)

**4. Misunderstanding of Messianic Role:**

They expected a political liberator, not a suffering servant. Peter himself initially rejected this:

> And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, saying, "Far be it from you, Lord! This shall never happen to you." But he turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are a hindrance to me. For you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man." — Matthew 16:22-23 (ESV)

**5. Many Did Believe:**

Not all leaders rejected Jesus:
- Nicodemus (John 3:1-2; 19:39)
- Joseph of Arimathea (Mark 15:43)
- Many priests (Acts 6:7)
- Paul (Philippians 3:5-6)

And thousands of ordinary Jews believed (Acts 2:41; 4:4; 21:20).

**6. Authority from God, Not Man:**

> No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him. — John 6:44 (ESV)

Faith is a gift from God, not achieved through human intellect or position.

---

## "The Genealogies in Matthew and Luke Differ"

### The Objection

Matthew 1 and Luke 3 give different genealogies for Jesus—different names, different number of generations.

### The Answer

**Two Lineages: Legal (Matthew) and Biological (Luke)**

**Matthew's Genealogy** (Matthew 1:1-17):
- Traces Jesus through **Joseph** (legal father)
- Descends through **Solomon** (kingly line)
- Establishes Jesus' *legal right* to David's throne

**Luke's Genealogy** (Luke 3:23-38):
- Traces Jesus through **Mary** (biological mother)
- Descends through **Nathan** (another son of David)
- Establishes Jesus' *biological descent* from David

Notice Luke 3:23:
> Jesus, when he began his ministry, was about thirty years of age, **being the son (as was supposed) of Joseph**, the son of Heli...

"As was supposed"—because Joseph wasn't his biological father. Luke traces through Mary's lineage (Heli was Mary's father, Joseph's father-in-law).

**Why Two Genealogies Matter:**

1. **Legal Right**: Through Joseph's adoption, Jesus inherits the throne legally
2. **Biological Descent**: Through Mary, Jesus is truly David's descendant by blood
3. **Prophecy Fulfilled**: Both lineages confirm Jesus as "son of David"

---

## "Islam Teaches Jesus Was Only a Prophet—Why Believe More?"

### Islamic View of Jesus (Isa)

Islam honors Jesus ('Isa) as:
- A great prophet (Quran 3:45-51)
- Born of a virgin (Quran 19:16-21)
- Performed miracles (Quran 3:49; 5:110)
- Will return before the Day of Judgment (Hadith)

But Islam denies:
- Jesus is the Son of God (Quran 4:171; 5:116-117)
- Jesus died on the cross (Quran 4:157-158)
- Jesus is divine (Quran 5:72-75)

### Why Believe Jesus Is More Than a Prophet?

**1. Jesus' Own Claims:**

Jesus didn't just claim to be *a* prophet—he claimed equality with God:

> I and the Father are one. — John 10:30 (ESV)

> Whoever has seen me has seen the Father. — John 14:9 (ESV)

> Before Abraham was, I am. — John 8:58 (ESV) *(using God's name from Exodus 3:14)*

The Jews understood his claim:
> This was why the Jews were seeking all the more to kill him, because not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even **calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God**. — John 5:18 (ESV)

If Jesus was merely a prophet, these claims make him a blasphemer or madman—not a good prophet.

**2. The Crucifixion Is Historical:**

Multiple non-Christian sources confirm Jesus was crucified:
- **Josephus** (Jewish historian, ~93 AD)
- **Tacitus** (Roman historian, ~116 AD)
- **Lucian of Samosata** (Greek satirist, ~165 AD)
- **Mara Bar-Serapion** (Stoic philosopher, ~73 AD)

The Quran's denial (Quran 4:157: "They did not kill him, nor did they crucify him") contradicts overwhelming historical evidence.

**3. The Resurrection Changes Everything:**

If Jesus merely died, he's a failed prophet. But if he rose from the dead (as eyewitnesses testified—1 Corinthians 15:3-8), this validates his claims to divinity.

No other prophet claimed to rise from death or demonstrated it.

**4. Prophecy Fulfillment:**

Jesus fulfilled 300+ specific prophecies—statistical impossibility by chance. Muhammad didn't fulfill Old Testament messianic prophecies.

**5. Why Would Disciples Die for a Lie?**

The apostles were tortured and martyred for claiming Jesus rose from the dead. People die for beliefs they think are true, but they don't die for *known* lies. If the resurrection was fabricated, the apostles knew it—why die for a deliberate deception?

**Respectful Conclusion:**

We honor Islam's recognition of Jesus as virgin-born, miracle-working, and returning. But the evidence suggests Jesus is *more*—not just a prophet, but the Son of God, the promised Messiah, Savior of the world.

# Conclusion: Objections Addressed, Coherence Demonstrated

## Summary

**Unfulfilled Prophecies:**
Explained by the two-comings model—Suffering Servant (first coming) and Conquering King (second coming). The already/not yet kingdom resolves apparent contradictions.

**Jesus' Unique Revelation:**
Clarified truths hinted in the Old Testament:
- Trinity
- Grace through faith
- Love for enemies
- Present/future kingdom
- Indwelling Holy Spirit
- Resurrection and eternal life
- New Covenant

**Other Objections:**
- Jewish rejection was prophesied
- Differing genealogies trace legal and biological lines
- Islamic view of Jesus, while respectful, doesn't match Jesus' own claims or historical evidence

## The Coherent Picture

When examined carefully, the Bible presents a coherent, progressive revelation:

1. **Old Testament**: Prophesies Messiah, foreshadows through types and shadows
2. **Jesus**: Fulfills prophecies, reveals hidden truths, accomplishes atonement
3. **Church Age**: Gospel preached to all nations, spiritual kingdom grows
4. **Second Coming**: Unfulfilled prophecies completed, physical kingdom established, eternal state begins

The objections, when honestly examined, have satisfactory biblical answers. The two-comings model isn't ad hoc rationalization—it's rooted in Scripture itself, which presents both a suffering servant and a conquering king.

## Invitation to Further Exploration

Questions answered, but more to discover:

- **Why did Jesus have to die? What did he accomplish?** → [Reconciliation and the New Covenant](reconciliation-and-covenant.draft.md)
- **What secular evidence exists for Jesus?** → [Contemporary Evidence](contemporary-evidence.draft.md)
- **What does following Jesus mean practically?** → [Why Follow Jesus](why-follow-jesus.draft.md)

The objections don't disprove Jesus as Messiah—they invite deeper understanding of God's eternal plan.
