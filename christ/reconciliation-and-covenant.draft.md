# Reconciliation and the New Covenant: Why Jesus Had to Come

## Introduction: The Core Question

Many focus on *whether* Jesus is the Messiah. But equally important: **Why did he have to come? What did he accomplish?**

If God wanted to save humanity, couldn't he just... forgive? Why the cross? Why the suffering? Why the blood?

And if Jesus fulfilled messianic prophecy, why don't we still offer animal sacrifices? Why no physical temple? How were people saved before Jesus came?

These aren't peripheral questions—they're central to understanding God's eternal plan.

This article explores:

1. **The Problem**: Humanity's separation from holy God
2. **Old Testament Solution**: How people were saved before Jesus
3. **Jesus' Accomplishment**: The ultimate sacrifice
4. **New Covenant**: What Jesus established
5. **Why No Temple**: Access to God redefined
6. **Why No More Sacrifices**: The finished work
7. **Why Jesus Alone**: No other way possible

# Part 1: The Problem—Humanity's Sin and Separation

## The Reality of Sin

**Universal Condition:**

> For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. — Romans 3:23 (ESV)

Not "most people" or "really bad people"—**all**. Every human being (except Jesus) has violated God's moral law.

**The Standard:**

God's character defines morality. He is perfectly:
- Holy (Leviticus 19:2; Isaiah 6:3)
- Just (Deuteronomy 32:4)
- Righteous (Psalm 145:17)

Sin isn't merely breaking arbitrary rules—it's falling short of God's perfect character.

**No One Righteous:**

> None is righteous, no, not one; no one understands; no one seeks for God. All have turned aside; together they have become worthless; no one does good, not even one. — Romans 3:10-12 (ESV)

Even our "good works" are tainted:

> We have all become like one who is unclean, and **all our righteous deeds are like a polluted garment**. We all fade like a leaf, and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away. — Isaiah 64:6 (ESV)

---

## The Consequence: Separation and Death

**Spiritual Separation:**

> But your iniquities have made a separation between you and your God, and your sins have hidden his face from you so that he does not hear. — Isaiah 59:2 (ESV)

Sin creates a barrier. Holy God cannot fellowship with sinful humanity in our natural state.

**Physical and Spiritual Death:**

> For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. — Romans 6:23 (ESV)

Death entered the world through sin (Genesis 2:17; Romans 5:12). Not just physical death, but spiritual separation from God—eternal death.

**The Divine Dilemma:**

God faces a tension:
- **Justice demands payment**: Sin must be punished (Exodus 34:7; Nahum 1:3)
- **Love desires salvation**: God doesn't want anyone to perish (2 Peter 3:9; Ezekiel 33:11)

How can God be both just (punishing sin) and loving (saving sinners)?

This is the problem Jesus came to solve.

# Part 2: Old Testament Solution—The Sacrificial System

## How Were People Saved Before Jesus?

### By Faith, Not Works

Even in the Old Testament, salvation was by **faith**, not perfect law-keeping:

**Abraham:**
> And he [Abraham] believed the LORD, and **he counted it to him as righteousness**. — Genesis 15:6 (ESV)

Paul confirms:
> For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God. For what does the Scripture say? "Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness." — Romans 4:2-3 (ESV)

**David:**
> Blessed is the one whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered. Blessed is the man against whom the LORD counts no iniquity. — Psalm 32:1-2 (ESV)

Paul quotes this:
> Just as David also speaks of the blessing of the one to whom God counts righteousness apart from works... — Romans 4:6 (ESV)

**The Pattern:**

Old Testament saints were saved by **faith** in God's promise of a coming deliverer, looking *forward* to the Messiah, just as we look *back* to him.

### The Role of Animal Sacrifices

If faith saves, why animal sacrifices?

**1. Demonstrated Seriousness of Sin:**

Sin isn't trivial. It requires death—either the sinner's or a substitute's.

> For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it for you on the altar to make atonement for your souls, **for it is the blood that makes atonement by the life**. — Leviticus 17:11 (ESV)

**2. Provided Temporary Covering:**

Sacrifices didn't *remove* sin permanently—they *covered* it temporarily:

> Blessed is the one whose transgression is forgiven, **whose sin is covered**. — Psalm 32:1 (ESV)

The Hebrew word for "atonement" (*kaphar*) means "to cover."

**3. Pointed Forward to Ultimate Sacrifice:**

Animal sacrifices were **types** and **shadows** pointing to the coming Messiah:

> Therefore let no one pass judgment on you in questions of food and drink, or with regard to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath. These are **a shadow of the things to come, but the substance belongs to Christ**. — Colossians 2:16-17 (ESV)

### The Limitations of Animal Sacrifices

The Old Testament system had inherent weaknesses:

**1. Repeated Constantly:**

> And every priest stands daily at his service, offering repeatedly the same sacrifices, **which can never take away sins**. — Hebrews 10:11 (ESV)

(Note: While avoiding Hebrews as *proof*, this historical observation is accurate—the temple sacrifices were continuous.)

Daily sacrifices, annual Day of Atonement—the repetition showed incompleteness.

**2. Animals Aren't Humans:**

How can an animal's death pay for human sin? Animals don't bear God's image, don't have moral agency, can't substitute adequately for humans.

**3. External, Not Internal:**

Sacrifices dealt with external ritual, but couldn't change the heart:

> For you will not delight in sacrifice, or I would give it; you will not be pleased with a burnt offering. The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise. — Psalm 51:16-17 (ESV)

David understood: God wants heart transformation, not mere ritual.

---

## God's Promise: A New Covenant

Recognizing the old system's limitations, God promised something better:

> Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when **I will make a new covenant** with the house of Israel and the house of Judah, **not like the covenant that I made with their fathers** on the day when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt, **my covenant that they broke**, though I was their husband, declares the LORD. For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares the LORD: **I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts**. And I will be their God, and they shall be my people. And no longer shall each one teach his neighbor and each his brother, saying, 'Know the LORD,' for **they shall all know me**, from the least of them to the greatest, declares the LORD. For **I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more**. — Jeremiah 31:31-34 (ESV)

Key elements:
1. **New**, not a renewal of the old
2. **Internalized**: Law written on hearts, not stone tablets
3. **Direct relationship**: All will know God personally
4. **Complete forgiveness**: Sins remembered no more

How would this happen? Through the Messiah.

---

# Part 3: Jesus—The Ultimate Sacrifice

## Uniquely Qualified

For a sacrifice to atone for humanity's sin, it needed to be:

1. **Human** (to represent humanity)
2. **Sinless** (or it would need a sacrifice for itself)
3. **Infinite value** (to cover all human sin for all time)

Only Jesus met these requirements.

### Fully Human

> Therefore he had to be made **like his brothers in every respect**, so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people. — Hebrews 2:17 (ESV)

Born of a woman (Galatians 4:4), experienced hunger, thirst, fatigue, temptation—fully human.

### Fully God

> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and **the Word was God**... And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us. — John 1:1, 14 (ESV)

> I and the Father are one. — John 10:30 (ESV)

Divine nature gives his sacrifice infinite value—able to cover all sins for all people for all time.

### Sinless

> He committed no sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth. — 1 Peter 2:22 (ESV)

> For our sake he [God] made him [Jesus] to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God. — 2 Corinthians 5:21 (ESV)

Even his enemies couldn't convict him of sin (John 8:46). Pilate declared, "I find no guilt in him" (John 18:38).

---

## Substitutionary Atonement

Jesus died **in our place**, as our **substitute**:

**Prophesied in Isaiah:**

> But he was pierced for **our** transgressions; he was crushed for **our** iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that brought **us** peace, and with his wounds **we** are healed. All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned—every one—to his own way; and the LORD has laid on him **the iniquity of us all**. — Isaiah 53:5-6 (ESV)

Notice the pronouns: **our** sins, **our** iniquities—his suffering. This is substitution.

**Jesus' Own Words:**

> For even the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and **to give his life as a ransom for many**. — Mark 10:45 (ESV)

A ransom is a payment to free captives. Jesus' life paid the price to free us from sin's penalty.

**Paul's Explanation:**

> For our sake he [God] made him [Jesus] to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God. — 2 Corinthians 5:21 (ESV)

The great exchange:
- Jesus takes our sin
- We receive his righteousness

**Peter's Testimony:**

> He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness. By his wounds you have been healed. — 1 Peter 2:24 (ESV)

---

## Once for All

Unlike animal sacrifices repeated daily, Jesus' sacrifice was **once for all time**:

> For Christ also suffered once for sins, **the righteous for the unrighteous**, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit. — 1 Peter 3:18 (ESV)

No repetition needed. No additional sacrifice required. **It is finished** (John 19:30).

---

## Satisfaction of Divine Justice

God's justice required payment. Jesus paid it:

> God put [Jesus] forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God's righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins. It was to show his righteousness at the present time, so that **he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus**. — Romans 3:25-26 (ESV)

**Propitiation** means "satisfaction of wrath." Jesus' death satisfied God's righteous wrath against sin, allowing God to be:
- **Just** (sin is punished—in Jesus)
- **Justifier** (sinners are forgiven—through faith in Jesus)

The divine dilemma resolved: Justice satisfied, love extended.

---

# Part 4: The New Covenant Established

## Jesus' Declaration

On the night before his crucifixion, Jesus instituted the Lord's Supper:

> And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, saying, "Drink of it, all of you, for this is **my blood of the covenant**, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins." — Matthew 26:27-28 (ESV)

Luke records:
> And likewise the cup after they had eaten, saying, **"This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood."** — Luke 22:20 (ESV)

Jesus explicitly connected his death to Jeremiah's New Covenant prophecy.

---

## Jeremiah's Elements Fulfilled

### 1. Law Written on Hearts

**Promise:**
> I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts. — Jeremiah 31:33

**Fulfillment:**

Through the Holy Spirit, God's law is internalized:

> You show that you are a letter from Christ delivered by us, written not with ink but **with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts**. — 2 Corinthians 3:3 (ESV)

> For the law of the Spirit of life has set you free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and death. — Romans 8:2 (ESV)

No longer external rules but internal transformation through the Spirit.

### 2. Direct Relationship with God

**Promise:**
> And no longer shall each one teach his neighbor and each his brother, saying, 'Know the LORD,' for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest. — Jeremiah 31:34

**Fulfillment:**

Direct access to God, no mediating priests:

> For there is one God, and **there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus**. — 1 Timothy 2:5 (ESV)

> Therefore, brothers, since we have confidence to enter the holy places **by the blood of Jesus**, by the new and living way that he opened for us through the curtain, that is, through his flesh... let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith. — Hebrews 10:19-20, 22 (ESV)

Every believer has direct access—not through priests, but through Jesus.

### 3. Complete Forgiveness

**Promise:**
> For I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more. — Jeremiah 31:34

**Fulfillment:**

> In him we have redemption through his blood, **the forgiveness of our trespasses**, according to the riches of his grace. — Ephesians 1:7 (ESV)

> If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. — 1 John 1:9 (ESV)

Not temporary covering but **permanent removal** of sin:

> As far as the east is from the west, so far does he remove our transgressions from us. — Psalm 103:12 (ESV)

---

# Part 5: Why No Physical Temple Needed

## The Temple's Purpose

The temple was the place where:
- God's presence dwelt (1 Kings 8:10-11)
- Sacrifices were offered (Leviticus 1-7)
- Priests mediated between God and people (Exodus 28-29)

It symbolized God dwelling with humanity.

---

## Jesus IS the New Temple

**Jesus' Declaration:**

> Jesus answered them, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up." The Jews then said, "It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and will you raise it up in three days?" But **he was speaking about the temple of his body**. — John 2:19-21 (ESV)

Jesus' body became the meeting place between God and humanity.

**God's Presence in Jesus:**

> And the Word became flesh and **dwelt** [Greek: *eskenosen*, "tabernacled"] among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth. — John 1:14 (ESV)

The Word (God the Son) *tabernacled* among us—the temple imagery is deliberate.

> For in him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily. — Colossians 2:9 (ESV)

God's full presence dwells in Jesus, not a building.

---

## Believers ARE the Temple

**Individual Believers:**

> Do you not know that **you are God's temple** and that God's Spirit dwells in you? — 1 Corinthians 3:16 (ESV)

> Or do you not know that your body is **a temple of the Holy Spirit** within you, whom you have from God? You are not your own, for you were bought with a price. So glorify God in your body. — 1 Corinthians 6:19-20 (ESV)

**Corporate Church:**

> In him the whole structure, being joined together, grows into **a holy temple in the Lord**. In him you also are being built together into **a dwelling place for God by the Spirit**. — Ephesians 2:21-22 (ESV)

God no longer dwells in stone buildings but in people—individually and corporately.

---

## The Veil Torn

At Jesus' death, the temple veil tore:

> And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice and yielded up his spirit. And behold, **the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom**. And the earth shook, and the rocks were split. — Matthew 27:50-51 (ESV)

**Significance:**

The veil separated the Most Holy Place (God's presence) from the outer courts. Only the high priest could enter, once a year, with blood (Leviticus 16).

When the veil tore:
- **From top to bottom** (God did it, not humans)
- **Access opened** for all believers
- **Barrier removed** between God and humanity

We now have direct access through Jesus' blood, not annual priestly mediation.

---

## The Final Vision: God Dwelling with Humanity

Revelation depicts the ultimate fulfillment—no temple at all:

> And I saw no temple in the city, for **its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb**. — Revelation 21:22 (ESV)

In the new creation, God's presence is direct and unmediated—the purpose of the temple fully realized.

---

# Part 6: Why No More Animal Sacrifices

## The Old System's Purpose

Animal sacrifices served temporary purposes:
1. Demonstrated sin's seriousness (death required)
2. Provided temporary atonement (covering, not removal)
3. Pointed forward to ultimate sacrifice (types and shadows)

---

## Jesus' Sacrifice Superseded Them

### Superior in Nature

**Human, Not Animal:**

Jesus was fully human, adequately representing humanity—unlike animals.

**Sinless, Not Sinful:**

Animals are morally neutral (not sinful, but not holy either). Jesus was positively righteous, qualified to bear others' sins.

**Voluntary, Not Coerced:**

> No one takes it [my life] from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it up again. — John 10:18 (ESV)

Jesus willingly offered himself, unlike animals dragged to slaughter.

### Superior in Effect

**Once for All, Not Repeated:**

> For Christ also suffered **once for sins**, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God. — 1 Peter 3:18 (ESV)

No daily, monthly, or annual repetition needed.

**Removes Sin, Not Just Covers:**

> The next day he [John the Baptist] saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, "Behold, **the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!**" — John 1:29 (ESV)

Not "covers" but "**takes away**"—permanent removal.

> In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace. — Ephesians 1:7 (ESV)

**Changes the Heart, Not Just External Status:**

Old sacrifices dealt with ritual impurity. Jesus' sacrifice transforms internally:

> I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you. And I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes and be careful to obey my rules. — Ezekiel 36:26-27 (ESV)

---

## "It Is Finished"

Jesus' final words on the cross:

> When Jesus had received the sour wine, he said, **"It is finished,"** and he bowed his head and gave up his spirit. — John 19:30 (ESV)

The Greek word *tetelestai* means "paid in full"—a financial term for completed payment.

The debt is paid. The work is done. No further sacrifice needed.

---

## Faith in His Blood, Not Animal Blood

Salvation now comes through faith in Jesus' blood, not animal sacrifices:

> Since, therefore, we have now been justified **by his blood**, much more shall we be saved by him from the wrath of God. — Romans 5:9 (ESV)

> And they have conquered him [Satan] **by the blood of the Lamb** and by the word of their testimony, for they loved not their lives even unto death. — Revelation 12:11 (ESV)

To return to animal sacrifices would be to reject Jesus' finished work—insulting to God's provision.

---

# Part 7: Why Jesus Is the ONLY Way

## The Exclusivity Claim

Jesus made an exclusive claim:

> Jesus said to him, "I am the way, and the truth, and the life. **No one comes to the Father except through me.**" — John 14:6 (ESV)

The apostles affirmed this:

> And there is salvation in no one else, for **there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved**. — Acts 4:12 (ESV)

**Why?** Isn't this narrow-minded? Couldn't God accept other paths?

---

## The Logic of Exclusivity

### 1. Only Sinless Substitute Acceptable

**The Standard:**

God is perfectly holy. Sin cannot coexist with holiness (Habakkuk 1:13).

**The Problem:**

All humans are sinful (Romans 3:23). We need a *sinless* substitute.

**The Solution:**

Only Jesus lived a sinless life:
- Muhammad never claimed sinlessness (Quran 40:55; 47:19; 48:2)
- Buddha never claimed sinlessness (acknowledged past karmic debt)
- Moses sinned (Numbers 20:12; Deuteronomy 32:51)
- All other religious leaders were sinners needing salvation themselves

Jesus alone qualifies as sinless substitute.

### 2. Only Divine-Human Bridge

**The Gap:**

Infinite holy God + finite sinful humanity = unbridgeable chasm.

**The Bridge:**

Requires someone both fully God (infinite value) and fully human (representing humanity).

> For there is one God, and there is **one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus**, who gave himself as a ransom for all. — 1 Timothy 2:5-6 (ESV)

No other religious figure claimed to be both fully God and fully man:
- Muhammad: prophet, not divine (Quran 18:110)
- Buddha: enlightened teacher, not deity
- Moses: prophet, servant of God
- Confucius: philosopher, teacher

Only Jesus is the God-man, uniquely qualified to bridge the gap.

### 3. Only One Who Conquered Death

**The Ultimate Enemy:**

Death is the final enemy, the consequence of sin (Romans 6:23; 1 Corinthians 15:26).

**The Victory:**

Jesus alone defeated death through resurrection:

> Death is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is your victory? O death, where is your sting? The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. But thanks be to God, **who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ**. — 1 Corinthians 15:54-57 (ESV)

Other religious founders:
- Remain in their graves (Muhammad's tomb in Medina, Buddha's relics enshrined)
- Or claimed escape from physical existence (Buddha's nirvana = extinguishing)

Only Jesus' tomb is empty. Only Jesus conquered death bodily.

### 4. Only Sacrifice God Accepted

**The Test:**

If God accepted Jesus' sacrifice, he would raise him from the dead:

> If Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile and you are still in your sins. — 1 Corinthians 15:17 (ESV)

**The Verdict:**

> But in fact **Christ has been raised from the dead**, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. — 1 Corinthians 15:20 (ESV)

The resurrection is God's "Amen" to Jesus' sacrifice—divine validation of its sufficiency.

---

## The Breadth of the Invitation

Though the *way* is singular, the *invitation* is universal:

> For God so loved **the world**, that he gave his only Son, that **whoever** believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. — John 3:16 (ESV)

> The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing that **any** should perish, but that **all** should reach repentance. — 2 Peter 3:9 (ESV)

Not exclusive by ethnicity, nationality, social status, or past sin—open to **all** who come through Jesus.

---

# Conclusion: God's Eternal Plan Fulfilled

## The Big Picture

From Genesis to Revelation, one consistent plan:

1. **Creation**: God creates humanity for fellowship (Genesis 1-2)
2. **Fall**: Sin separates humanity from God (Genesis 3)
3. **Promise**: God promises a deliverer (Genesis 3:15)
4. **Preparation**: Law reveals sin, sacrifices point to Messiah (Exodus-Malachi)
5. **Fulfillment**: Jesus comes, lives sinlessly, dies substitutionarily, rises victoriously (Gospels)
6. **Application**: Gospel preached, people saved by faith (Acts-Epistles)
7. **Consummation**: Jesus returns, establishes eternal kingdom (Revelation)

---

## What Jesus Accomplished

**Reconciliation:**
> All this is from God, who through Christ **reconciled us to himself** and gave us the ministry of reconciliation; that is, in Christ God was **reconciling the world to himself**, not counting their trespasses against them. — 2 Corinthians 5:18-19 (ESV)

**Redemption:**
> In him we have **redemption** through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace. — Ephesians 1:7 (ESV)

**Justification:**
> Therefore, since we have been **justified by faith**, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. — Romans 5:1 (ESV)

**Adoption:**
> But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, **he gave the right to become children of God**. — John 1:12 (ESV)

**Eternal Life:**
> And this is the testimony, that God gave us eternal life, and **this life is in his Son**. Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life. — 1 John 5:11-12 (ESV)

---

## The Response Required

Understanding *what* Jesus did leads to *how* to respond:

**Recognize Need:**
> For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. — Romans 3:23 (ESV)

**Believe in Jesus:**
> For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that **whoever believes in him** should not perish but have eternal life. — John 3:16 (ESV)

**Confess and Trust:**
> If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, **you will be saved**. — Romans 10:9 (ESV)

**Receive Forgiveness:**
> If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. — 1 John 1:9 (ESV)

---

## Next Steps in Understanding

This article explained *why* and *how* Jesus reconciled humanity to God. But more evidence exists:

- **Historical Confirmation**: [Contemporary Evidence](contemporary-evidence.draft.md)—Lee Strobel's research, archaeological discoveries, non-Christian historians
- **Practical Response**: [Why Follow Jesus](why-follow-jesus.draft.md)—What discipleship looks like
- **Foundation**: [Old Testament Prophecies](prophecies.draft.md)—The biblical blueprint Jesus fulfilled

The New Covenant is established. The temple veil is torn. The sacrifice is complete. Access to God is open.

The question remaining: Will you enter through the door Jesus opened?

> I am the door. If anyone enters by me, **he will be saved** and will go in and out and find pasture. — John 10:9 (ESV)
