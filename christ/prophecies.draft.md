# Fulfilled Prophecies about Jesus

- To Christians, he is [the Christ](../christ.md), [the Son of God](https://son.ofgod.info) and [the Son of Man](https://son.ofgod.info/son-of-man)
- To Muslims, he is a revered prophet, born of a virgin, but not God's Son
- To Jews, he was a teacher who didn't fulfill messianic prophecies
- To secularists, he was perhaps a wise moral teacher, but nothing more

According to the Bible, God made several promises about the Christ.

If Jesus is the Christ, it changes everything. How we understand God, ourselves, history, and our eternal destiny.

Luke, who gathered many witness accounts, recorded:

> Beginning with **Moses and all the Prophets**, he *(Jesus)* interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself. — Luke 24:27 (ESV)

Jesus claimed that the Old Testament Scriptures testified about him. The question is: *Do they?*

## Genealogy

The lineage is explicitly documented: [Abraham](#the-abrahamic-blessing) → [Judah](#the-scepter-of-judah) → [Jesse](#descended-from-jesse) → [David](#the-davidic-covenant-an-eternal-throne) → Jesus.

### The Abrahamic Blessing

#### Prophecy

God promised Abraham that through his descendant, all nations would be blessed:

> And **in your offspring shall all the nations of the earth be blessed**, because you have obeyed my voice. — Genesis 22:18 (ESV)

Not just Israel, but *all nations* which is a universal blessing through one specific descendant.

#### Fulfillment

The apostle Peter explicitly applied this promise to Jesus:

> And when Peter saw it he addressed the people: "Men of Israel... you are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant that God made with your fathers, saying to Abraham,
>
>> 'And **in your offspring shall all the families of the earth be blessed**.' — Genesis 22:18
>
> God, having raised up His servant, sent him to you first, to **bless you by turning every one of you from your wickedness**."
>
> And as they were speaking to the people, the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came upon them, greatly annoyed because they were teaching the people and proclaiming in **Jesus** the resurrection from the dead.
>
> — Acts 3:12,25-26, 4:1-2 (ESV)

* The Jewish view is that **the nation Israel** is the promised offspring through whom all nations are blessed.
* The Peter's view is that "God's servant" (**Jesus**) is the promised offspring through whom all nations are blessed.

### The Scepter of Judah

#### Prophecy

Jacob, blessing his sons before death, prophesied about Judah's line:

> **The scepter shall not depart from Judah**, nor the ruler's staff from between his feet, until tribute comes to him; and **to him shall be the obedience of the peoples**. — Genesis 49:10 (ESV)

A ruler would come from Judah's tribe who would command the obedience of peoples.

#### Fulfillment

The Gospel of Matthew establishes Jesus' Judahite lineage:

> The book of the genealogy of **Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham**: Abraham was the father of Isaac, and Isaac the father of Jacob, and Jacob the father of **Judah** and his brothers... — Matthew 1:1-2 (ESV)

* Although the Jews accept this prophecy as Messianic, they expected a political ruler.
* Christians understand this prophecy is only partially fulfilled, as Jesus was in the lineage of Judah, but the world still does not acknowledge him as the King.

### Descended from Jesse

#### Prophecy

Isaiah specified the Messiah's lineage through Jesse (David's father):

> There shall come forth **a shoot from the stump of Jesse, and a branch from his roots** shall bear fruit. And **the Spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him**:
> * the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, 
> * the Spirit of counsel and might,
> * the Spirit of knowledge and the fear of the LORD. 
> And his delight shall be in the fear of the LORD.
>
> He shall not judge by what his eyes see, or decide disputes by what his ears hear, but **with righteousness he shall judge** the poor, and decide with equity for the meek of the earth; and **he shall strike the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips he shall kill the wicked**. **Righteousness shall be the belt of his waist**, and faithfulness the belt of his loins. 
>
> — Isaiah 11:1-5 (ESV)

The Messiah would be Spirit-empowered and from David's family line.

Isaiah prophesied that the Messiah would judge and strike the wicked. Jesus confirmed He has this authority, but revealed a crucial distinction: believers who hear His word and trust in God escape this judgment entirely, passing from death to life. Only those who reject Him face the judgment Isaiah foretold. There is no contradiction.

Regarding the judgement Isaiah prophecied, Jesus warned:

> For the Father judges no one, but has given **all judgment to [the Son](https://son.ofgod.info)**, that all may honor the Son, just as they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him.
>
> Truly, truly, I say to you, **whoever hears my word and believes Him who sent me has eternal life. He does not come into judgment**, but has passed from death to life.
>
> Truly, truly, I say to you, an hour is coming, and is now here, when the dead will hear the voice of [the Son of God](https://son.ofgod.info), and **those who hear will live**. For as the Father has life in himself, so **He has granted the Son** also to have life in himself. And **He has given him authority to execute judgment**, because he is [the Son of Man](https://son.ofgod.info/son-of-man). Do not marvel at this, for an hour is coming when all who are in the tombs will hear his voice and come out, those who have done good to **the resurrection of life**, and those who have done evil to **the resurrection of judgment**. 
>
> I can do nothing on my own. **As I hear, I judge, and my judgment is just**, because I seek not my own will but the will of Him who sent me.
>
> — John 5:22-30 (ESV)

#### Fulfillment

Matthew's genealogy traces Jesus through Jesse:

> The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham: Abraham was the father of Isaac, and Isaac the father of Jacob, and Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers... and Salmon the father of Boaz by Rahab, and Boaz the father of Obed by Ruth, and **Obed the father of Jesse**, and **Jesse the father of David** the king. — Matthew 1:1-6 (ESV)

#### Jewish Perspective

**Accepted as Messianic.** Isaiah 11:1-5 is universally recognized in Jewish tradition as a prophecy about the Messiah. 

However, Jews argue Jesus did not fulfill the complete context of this passage. The prophecy continues (Isaiah 11:6-9) describing a world where "the wolf shall dwell with the lamb" and "the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD" which depicts universal peace and knowledge of God. Jews contend that since these conditions did not materialize during or after Jesus' lifetime. The passage describes the Messiah "striking the earth with the rod of his mouth" and "killing the wicked". These actions Jews interpret as literal, visible judgment that Jesus did not perform.

#### Christian Perspective

Christians understand this prophecy is only partially fulfilled, as Jesus was in the lineage of Jesse, but he still need to judge the world for their sin. Jesus promised that he will return to do this in the future.

### The Davidic Covenant: An Eternal Throne

#### Prophecy

God made a covenant with King David, promising an eternal kingdom through his descendant:

> When your days are fulfilled and you lie down with your fathers, **I will raise up your offspring after you**, who shall come from your body, and I will establish his kingdom. 
> 1. He shall build a house for My name, and 
> 2. I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. I will be to him a father, and he shall be to Me a son... 
> 3. And your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before you. Your throne shall be established forever.
>
> — 2 Samuel 7:12-16 (ESV)

Note the key promise: **forever**. Not a temporary dynasty but an *eternal* throne.

#### Fulfillment

Gabriel's annunciation to Mary directly applied this eternal throne to Jesus:

> He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. And **the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David**, and **he will reign over the house of Jacob forever**, and **of his kingdom there will be no end**. — Luke 1:32-33 (ESV)

Peter's Pentecost sermon confirmed this:

> Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that **God had sworn with an oath to him that he would set one of his descendants on his throne, he foresaw and spoke about the resurrection of the Christ**. — Acts 2:30 (ESV)

Peter's view is that Jesus is this eternal king from David's linage.

#### Jewish Perspective

**Accepted as Messianic.** The Davidic Covenant in 2 Samuel 7 is foundational to Jewish messianic expectation. Jews fully expect the Messiah to be a descendant of David who will restore David's throne. However, Jewish objections to Jesus center on the nature and timing of this kingdom: 

1. The prophecy speaks of building "a house for my name", but Jews interpret this literally as **the Third Temple**, which has not been built; 
2. The eternal throne implies continuous, visible reign, but Jesus did not establish **a visible political kingdom**; 
3. The prophecy says "your throne shall be established forever", but Jews argue this means an **dynasty of unbroken succession of Davidic kings** ruling from Jerusalem, which did not occur after Jesus.

#### Christian Perspective

1. The "house" is a metaphor for the body of believers who follow Christ. Each member is part of this "house" according to Jesus teachings.
2. Jesus is considered the King of the non-political (invisible) Kingdom of God.
3. Because God resurrected Jesus from the dead, he Himself (not a dynasty) will now live forever and rule forever as the King.

## Birth Prophecies

### Born in Bethlehem

#### Prophecy

The prophet Micah, writing approximately 700 BC during the reigns of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah (Micah 1:1), specified the Messiah's birthplace:

> But you, **Bethlehem Ephrathah**, though you are little among the thousands of Judah, yet **out of you shall come forth to me the one to be ruler in Israel**, whose goings forth are from of old, from everlasting. — Micah 5:2 (NKJV)

The prophecy is remarkable for its specificity—not Jerusalem (the royal capital), not Hebron (David's first capital), but tiny Bethlehem, a village so small it wasn't listed among Judah's major towns (Joshua 15:21-62).

#### Fulfillment

Though Jesus' family lived in Nazareth, circumstances beyond their control brought Mary to Bethlehem precisely when her child was due:

> In those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be registered... And Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the town of Nazareth, to Judea, to **the city of David, which is called Bethlehem**, because he was of the house and lineage of David, to be registered with Mary, his betrothed, who was with child. And while they were there, the time came for her to give birth. And she gave birth to her firstborn son. — Luke 2:1-7 (ESV); see also Matthew 2:1-8

Jesus was born exactly where Micah predicted, seven centuries earlier.

#### Jewish Perspective

**Messianic Recognition.** First-century Jewish authorities clearly recognized Micah 5:2 as a messianic prophecy, immediately citing it when Herod inquired where the Messiah would be born (Matthew 2:4-6). This understanding is reflected in rabbinic literature (Targum, Talmud, Midrash). The expectation that Messiah would come from Bethlehem was common knowledge (John 7:42).

**The Contextual Objection.** However, Jewish scholars argue that being born in Bethlehem is insufficient evidence of messiahship because the immediate context of Micah 4-5 describes the Messiah accomplishing specific military and political deliverances that Jesus did not fulfill:

> Now muster your troops, O daughter of troops; **siege is laid against us**;
> **with a rod they strike the judge of Israel on the cheek**.
>
> But you, O Bethlehem Ephrathah, who are too little to be among the clans of Judah, from you shall come forth for me one who is to be ruler in Israel, whose coming forth is from of old, from ancient days.
>
> Therefore he shall give them up until the time when she who is in labor has given birth; then the rest of his brothers shall return to the people of Israel. And he shall stand and shepherd his flock in the strength of the LORD, in the majesty of the name of the LORD his God. And **they shall dwell secure**, for now **he shall be great to the ends of the earth**. And **he shall be their peace. When the Assyrian comes into our land and treads in our palaces**, then we will raise against him seven shepherds and eight princes of men; they shall shepherd the land of Assyria with the sword, and the land of Nimrod at its entrances; and **he shall deliver us from the Assyrian** when he comes into our land and treads within our border.
>
> Then the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many peoples like dew from the LORD, like showers on the grass, which delay not for a man nor wait for the children of man. And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the nations, in the midst of many peoples, like a lion among the beasts of the forest, like a young lion among the flocks of sheep, which, when it goes through, treads down and tears in pieces, and there is none to deliver. **Your hand shall be lifted up over your adversaries**, and **all your enemies shall be cut off**.
>
> — Micah 4:11-5:9 (ESV)

The Jewish objection centers on tangible, unfulfilled expectations: Jesus did not establish visible peace, did not defeat Israel's enemies militarily, did not cause the Jewish people to "dwell secure," and did not bring material wealth to the nation. The prophecy speaks of defeating "the Assyrian"—yet when Rome (not Assyria) destroyed Jerusalem in 70 AD, Jesus had already been crucified and did not deliver his people.

#### Christian Perspective

**Historical Context.** Micah prophesied when the Assyrian Empire was the dominant superpower threatening Judah's existence. The Northern Kingdom (Israel) had fallen to Assyria in 722 BC, and Judah narrowly escaped conquest during Hezekiah's reign (2 Kings 18-19). Assyria eventually fell between 612-609 BC when Babylon conquered Nineveh—but this occurred centuries before Jesus, with no connection to the Messiah's birth.

**Interpretive Approaches.** Christians respond to the contextual objection through several frameworks:

1. **Dual or Multiple Fulfillment.** Micah 5:1 ("with a rod they strike the judge of Israel on the cheek") finds partial fulfillment in Jesus' suffering (Matthew 27:30), while the military deliverance awaits his second coming. Many prophecies have both near-term historical and far-term messianic fulfillments.

2. **Spiritual Kingdom Theology.** Jesus' kingdom is "not of this world" (John 18:36). The "peace" he brings is spiritual reconciliation with God (Romans 5:1; Ephesians 2:14-17), and the "enemies" being defeated are sin, death, and Satan (1 Corinthians 15:24-26; Colossians 2:15)—not political nations. Under this view, the military language of Micah 4-5 functions as metaphor for spiritual realities.

3. **Eschatological Fulfillment.** The unfulfilled elements await Christ's second coming, when he will return as conquering king (Revelation 19:11-21), establish visible peace (Isaiah 2:4; 11:6-9), and rule from Jerusalem (Zechariah 14:9, 16-17). Christians point to passages like Acts 1:11, 1 Thessalonians 4:16, and Hebrews 10:12-13 that describe Jesus' future return to complete his messianic work.

4. **"Assyrian" as Archetype.** Some interpreters view "the Assyrian" not as the historical empire (which ceased to exist by 609 BC) but as a prophetic archetype representing any future enemy of God's people—potentially fulfilled in Rome's defeat, or awaiting a future antichrist figure (2 Thessalonians 2:3-12).

**The Tension.** Christians acknowledge the legitimate tension: Jesus fulfilled Micah 5:2 precisely (birthplace), and arguably Micah 5:1 (suffering), but the military triumph described in Micah 5:3-9 remains unfulfilled in ways that first-century Jews expected. This requires either reinterpreting the military language spiritually, or deferring its fulfillment to a future event. Most Christians hold that Jesus' literal birth in Bethlehem validates the prophecy's messianic application to him, while the manner and timing of fulfilling the surrounding context may differ from initial Jewish expectations.

### Born of a Virgin

#### Prophecy

Isaiah prophesied an extraordinary birth:

> Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, **the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel**. — Isaiah 7:14 (ESV)

#### Fulfillment

Mary conceived virginally through the Holy Spirit:

> When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together **she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit**. And her husband Joseph, being a just man and unwilling to put her to shame, resolved to divorce her quietly. But as he considered these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, "Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for **that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit**. She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins." All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet: **"Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel"** (which means, God with us). — Matthew 1:18-23 (ESV)

Nobody, called Jesus "Immanuel", yet Matthew considered Jesus birth was a fulfillment.

#### Jewish Perspective

**Rejected as Messianic.** Isaiah 7:14 is one of the most disputed prophecies. Jewish scholars raise several objections: 
1. **Translation dispute**: The Hebrew word "almah" (עַלְמָה) means "young woman" not necessarily "virgin"—the specific word for virgin is "betulah" (בְּתוּלָה). The Septuagint translated it as "parthenos" (virgin), but Jews argue this was an error;
2. **Historical context**: Isaiah 7:14 was a sign given to King Ahaz about events in his own time (~735 BC), not 700 years future. The child is widely interpreted as King Hezekiah or Isaiah's own son (see Isaiah 8:3-4);
3. **Immediate fulfillment**: Isaiah 7:15-16 describes the child eating "curds and honey" and knowing good from evil before the two threatening kings are destroyed and this happened within a few years, not centuries later;
4. **Not a messianic passage**: Jews argue Isaiah 7 contains no messianic context, but instead it's about the Syro-Ephraimite War, not the Messiah. The virgin birth concept is seen as a later Christian reinterpretation of a text with an original, contemporary meaning.

#### Christian Perspective

* Christians view this as miraculous, unique birth from a literal virgin as a sign of fulfillment.
* [Trinitarian](https://son.ofgod.info/trinity) Christians understand that "God with us" means that God reincarnated into the baby Jesus.
* Unitarian Christians understand that "God with us" means that God was on their side, to defeat death by providing a solution to salvation. 

### Titles of Divine Authority

#### Prophecy

Isaiah described the coming child with remarkable titles:

> For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and **the government shall be upon his shoulder**, and his name shall be called **Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God,
Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace**. Of the increase of his government and of peace **there will be no end**, on the throne of David and over his kingdom, to establish it and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness from this time forth and **forevermore**... — Isaiah 9:6-7 (ESV)

#### Fulfillment

Traditionally, [Trinitarian](https://son.ofgod.info/trinity) Christians understood that this is a prophetic word about a child who would bear *titles of deity* and establishes an *eternal* government.

While did claim to be the Jesus is the King (Matthew 28:18-19) of the eternal Kingdom of God, they often overlook the next part of the prophecy:

> The zeal of the LORD of hosts will do this. The Lord has sent a word against Jacob, and it will fall on Israel; — Isaiah 9:7-8 (ESV)

This suggest that the prophecy was not intended to be Messianic and was referring to a judgment on Israel against Judah in the days of Isaiah.

#### Jewish Perspective

**Debated/Accepted as Messianic.** Most Jewish scholars reject the Christian interpretation of divine titles: 
1. **Translation issues**: "Mighty God" (El Gibbor) in Hebrew doesn't necessarily mean deity, because it can also mean "mighty hero" or "divine warrior." The term "Everlasting Father" is interpreted as "father of eternity" meaning a long-lived or enduring ruler, not "God the Father"; 
2. **Historical context**: Some argue verses 6-7 originally referred to King Hezekiah as a contemporary fulfillment; 
3. **Unfulfilled conditions**: The prophecy promises "of the increase of his government and of peace there will be no end" which the Jews argue require a visible, earthly peace and ever-expanding territorial rule, which Jesus did not establish; 
4. **Temporal disconnect**: Since the prophecy speaks of a child "born to us" in past tense and "government on his shoulders" in present/future tense, Jews argue this describes events in Isaiah's own era, possibly Hezekiah's birth and reign.

## Ministry and Teaching

### The Prophet Like Moses

#### Prophecy

Moses, the great lawgiver, predicted a future prophet who would surpass even his own authority:

> “The LORD your God will raise up for you **a prophet like me from among you**, from your brothers⁠—it is to him you shall listen⁠— **just as you desired of the LORD your God at Horeb on the day of the assembly**, when you said, ‘Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God or see this great fire any more, lest I die.’ And the LORD said to me, ‘They are right in what they have spoken. **I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their brothers**. And **I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them all that I command him**. And whoever will not listen to my words that he shall speak in my name, I myself will require it of him.
— Deuteronomy 18:15-19 (ESV)

The prophecy emphasizes that this prophet would be a unique **prophet-mediator like Moses**—one who both **speaks God's words** ("I will put my words in his mouth") and **stands as covenant intermediary** between God and the people. This refers to what happened at Mount Horeb: when Israel heard God's terrifying voice directly, they asked Moses to mediate—to stand between them and God, receiving God's words and conveying them to the people. God approved this arrangement, making Moses the covenant mediator through whom He would communicate.

Moses' role was unique. While there were many prophets after Moses who spoke God's words, none functioned as a prophet-mediator in the way Moses did:

1. None stood as covenant mediator between God and Israel, establishing covenant relationship
2. None gave covenant laws with provisions for atonement and reconciliation
3. None miraculously provided food for Israel like Moses did with manna

Biblical mediation involves both **communication** (speaking God's words as intermediary) and **reconciliation** (establishing covenant, turning people from sin). Moses performed both functions, making him more than just a prophet.

#### Fulfillment: The Crowd Recognizes the Sign

After Jesus miraculously fed 5,000 people, the crowd immediately recognized him as the prophet Moses foretold, focusing on the miraculous sign—a prophet who could provide food like Moses provided manna:

> Jesus then took the loaves, and when he had given thanks, he distributed them to those who were seated. So also the fish, as much as they wanted. And when they had eaten their fill, he told his disciples, "Gather up the leftover fragments, that nothing may be lost."
>
> So they gathered them up and filled twelve baskets with fragments from the five barley loaves left by those who had eaten.
>
> **When the people saw the sign** that he had done, they said, **"This is indeed the Prophet who is to come into the world!"**
>
> Perceiving then that they were about to come and take him by force to make him king, Jesus withdrew again to the mountain by himself. — John 6:11-15 (ESV)

The crowd's response shows they recognized that Jesus could provide food like Moses provided manna.

#### Fulfillment: Peter Emphasizes the Purpose

Peter explicitly identified Jesus as the prophet Moses foretold, emphasizing the purpose of the prophet-mediator role—**reconciling humanity to God**:

> For Moses truly said to the fathers,
>
>> 'The LORD your God will raise up for you **a prophet like me** from your brethren. Him you shall hear in all things, whatever he says to you. And it shall be that every soul who will not hear that prophet shall be utterly destroyed from among the people.'...
>
> To you first, God, having **raised up his servant Jesus, sent him** to bless you, in **turning away every one of you from your iniquities**. — Acts 3:22-26 (NKJV)

Peter's interpretation focuses on the reconciliation aspect of mediation: "turning away from your iniquities" and "blessing you." This is the covenant mediator's ultimate purpose—not merely to perform signs or deliver messages, but to establish peace between God and humanity by resolving sin. Peter understood the prophetic purpose was to establish a covenant of reconciliation like Moses establishing the Mosaic Covenant.

#### Jewish Perspective

**Debated Whether Messianic.** Deuteronomy 18:15-19 is interpreted in multiple ways within Jewish tradition: 
1. **Continuous fulfillment**: Many Jewish scholars argue this refers to the entire line of prophets throughout Israel's history, not one specific individual. Each authentic prophet was "like Moses" in speaking God's words; 
2. **The Messiah**: Some rabbinic sources do apply this to the Messiah, but emphasize the Messiah will be "like Moses" in leading Israel to political freedom and establishing God's law, which Jesus did not do; 
3. **Criteria not met**: Jews argue Jesus doesn't match Moses' role—Moses gave the Torah which remains eternal and unchangeable (Deuteronomy 4:2; 13:1-5), whereas Christians claim Jesus brought a "new covenant" superseding Mosaic law. This contradicts the "like Moses" comparison; 
4. **False prophet test**: Deuteronomy 13:1-5 warns against prophets who perform signs but lead Israel away from Torah observance. Jews claim Jesus fits this description by advocating for setting aside dietary laws, Sabbath restrictions, and temple sacrifice.

#### Christian Perspective

Christians offer several responses to these Jewish objections:

1. **Singular prophet, not continuous line**: The Hebrew text uses singular forms ("a prophet," "him") rather than plural, suggesting one specific individual (Deuteronomy 18:15, 19). First-century Jews expected "the Prophet" as a distinct figure (John 1:21, 6:14, 7:40), and the Dead Sea Scrolls (4Q175, c. 100 BCE) list a singular "prophet like Moses" as an expected messianic figure. Deuteronomy 34:10 states "no prophet has risen in Israel like Moses," emphasizing his unique status that no subsequent prophet matched until Jesus came;

2. **Spiritual freedom precedes political kingdom**: Christians argue Moses' primary role was covenant mediator, not merely political liberator (Exodus 7:16 emphasizes serving God, not just political freedom). The Old Testament prophecies describe two comings of Messiah: first for spiritual redemption (Isaiah 53—suffering servant) and second for political kingdom (Isaiah 11:1-10). Jesus fulfilled the first coming by delivering humanity from spiritual bondage to sin (John 8:36, 18:36), with the visible messianic kingdom awaiting the Second Coming;

3. **Fulfillment, not abolition**: Christians point to Jeremiah 31:31-34, where God Himself promises a "new covenant... not like the covenant" made at Sinai, with the law written on hearts rather than stone tablets. Jesus claimed to "fulfill" the Torah, not "abolish" it (Matthew 5:17-20). Christians distinguish between moral law (eternal principles like love God and neighbor, which Jesus intensified in Matthew 5:21-48) and ceremonial law (sacrifices and priesthood which were "shadows" pointing to Christ and fulfilled by His work, Colossians 2:16-17, Hebrews 10:1-18). Deuteronomy 4:2 prohibits human additions to the original Torah, not divine progressive revelation through prophets. Like Moses who brought covenant terms from God, Jesus as prophet-mediator brought new covenant terms as Jeremiah predicted within the Old Testament itself;

4. **The test is idolatry, not ceremonial law**: Christians note Deuteronomy 13:1-5 tests whether a prophet leads people to worship "other gods," not whether ceremonial practices change. Jesus consistently affirmed monotheism (Mark 12:29, quoting Deuteronomy 6:4) and never led people away from the God of Israel. Regarding specific practices: Jesus challenged Pharisaic hand-washing traditions (human additions, not Torah itself, Mark 7:1-13), performed works of necessity and mercy on Sabbath while regularly attending synagogue (Luke 4:16, Matthew 12:1-14). Far from lowering Torah's standards, Jesus intensified moral requirements—declaring anger equivalent to murder and lust to adultery (Matthew 5:21-48). The Pharisees could never prove Jesus broke God's law (John 8:46) and resorted to false witnesses at His trial (Matthew 26:59-60).

### The beloved servant of God

#### Prophecy

Isaiah depicted the Messiah's demeanor:

> Behold! **My servant** whom I uphold, My elect one **in whom My soul delights**! I have **put My Spirit upon him**; he will bring forth justice to the Gentiles. He will not cry out, nor raise his voice, nor cause his voice to be heard in the street. A bruised reed he will not break, and smoking flax he will not quench; he will bring forth justice for truth. — Isaiah 42:1-3 (NKJV)

> Behold **My servant**, whom I uphold, My chosen, **in whom My soul delights**; I have put **My Spirit upon him**; he will bring forth justice to the nations.
>
> He will not cry aloud or lift up his voice, or make it heard in the street; a bruised reed he will not break, and a faintly burning wick he will not quench; he will faithfully bring forth justice. He will not grow faint or be discouraged till he has established justice in the earth; and the coastlands wait for his law.
>
> — Isaiah 42:1-4

#### Fulfillment

Matthew records Jesus' gentle approach:

> But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew from there. And great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all. Yet he warned them not to make him known, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying: 
>
>> Behold! **My servant** whom I have chosen, **My beloved in whom My soul is well pleased**! I will **put My Spirit upon him**, and he will declare justice to the Gentiles. He will not quarrel nor cry out, nor will anyone hear his voice in the streets. A bruised reed he will not break, and smoking flax he will not quench, till he sends forth justice to victory; and in his name Gentiles will trust...
>
> — Matthew 12:15-21 (NKJV)

* Jesus served God (Matthew 12:18; Philippians 2:7-8).
* God personally and publically declared Jesus "My beloved in whom My soul is well pleased" (Matthew 3:17; 17:5; cf. John 12:28-29)!
* God has put His Spirit upon Jesus (Matthew 3:16; 12:18; John 1:32-33).

#### Jewish Perspective

**Debated Whether Messianic.** Isaiah 42:1-4 is part of the "Servant Songs" in Isaiah, which Jews interpret in multiple ways: 

1. **Israel as servant**: The predominant Jewish interpretation identifies the "servant" as the nation of Israel collectively (see Isaiah 41:8-9; 44:1-2, 21; 45:4; 49:3 where Israel is explicitly called "my servant"), not an individual Messiah; 
2. **The prophet Isaiah**: Some see this as Isaiah describing his own mission; 
3. **Incomplete fulfillment**: Even if applied to Messiah, Jews argue Jesus didn't fulfill verse 4: "He will not grow faint or be discouraged till he has established justice in the earth; and the coastlands wait for his law"—justice was not established globally, and the world doesn't follow Jesus' teachings as law; 
4. **Gentile focus problematic**: The passage emphasizes bringing justice to Gentiles, but Jews argue the Messiah's primary mission is restoring Israel first, then influencing the world through Israel's example (Isaiah 2:2-3).

#### Christian Perspective

**Individual Servant, Not Collective Israel.** Christians respond that while Israel is called "servant" in some contexts (Isaiah 41:8-9; 44:1-2), the Servant Songs (Isaiah 42:1-4; 49:1-6; 50:4-9; 52:13-53:12) describe an individual who:

1. **Brings Israel back to God** (Isaiah 49:5-6)—the servant cannot be Israel bringing itself back to God, so must be distinct from the nation;
2. **Suffers for Israel's sins** (Isaiah 53:4-6, 8)—"He was wounded for our transgressions... the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all"—Israel cannot vicariously suffer for its own sins;
3. **Is sinless** (Isaiah 53:9)—"He had done no violence, nor was any deceit in his mouth"—this doesn't describe sinful Israel who had been in multiple battles;
4. **Dies and rises** (Isaiah 53:8-10, 12)—the servant is "cut off from the land of the living" yet "shall prolong his days" and "divide the spoil"—describing resurrection, not Israel's national restoration.

The shift from corporate "servant" (Isaiah 41-44) to individual "servant" (in the Servant Songs) indicates a specific person who represents and redeems Israel (Romans 9:6; Galatians 3:16, 29).

**Not Isaiah's Personal Mission.** Christians argue Isaiah himself didn't fulfill the servant prophecies:

1. **Isaiah wasn't given the Spirit** in the dramatic way described (Isaiah 42:1; 61:1; cf. Matthew 3:16);
2. **Didn't bring justice to Gentiles globally** (Isaiah 42:1,4, 49:6)—Isaiah's ministry was primarily to Judah;
3. **Didn't suffer vicariously** (Isaiah 53)—Isaiah wasn't despised and rejected, didn't die for others' sins, wasn't buried with the rich;
4. **Didn't rise from death** (Isaiah 53:10-12)—the servant's resurrection distinguishes this from any prophet's experience.

**Two-Stage Fulfillment: Already and Not Yet.** Christians acknowledge the tension in Isaiah 42:4 ("till he has established justice in the earth") but explain this through the concept of two comings:

1. **First Coming (Past)**: Jesus established **spiritual justice** through his death and resurrection (Romans 3:21-26; 5:1)—justifying believers and inaugurating God's kingdom (Mark 1:15; Luke 17:20-21; Colossians 1:13);
2. **Second Coming (Future)**: Jesus will establish **universal justice** when he returns (Matthew 25:31-46; Acts 17:31; Revelation 19:11-16).

The "already but not yet" nature of God's kingdom means Messiah can fulfill prophecies progressively: Isaiah 53 (suffering) fulfilled at first coming, Isaiah 42:4 (global justice) fulfilled at second coming. Jesus himself distinguished these stages (Luke 4:18-21 vs. Isaiah 61:2; Matthew 13:24-43).

**Gentile Inclusion Was Always God's Plan.** Christians argue the Gentile focus isn't problematic because:

1. **Abrahamic Covenant included all nations** (Genesis 12:3; 22:18)—"In you all the families of the earth shall be blessed";
2. **Isaiah repeatedly emphasizes Gentile salvation** (Isaiah 2:2-4; 42:1, 6; 49:6; 60:3)—"I will make you as a light for the nations, that my salvation may reach to the end of the earth";
3. **Messiah's mission encompasses both Israel and nations** (Isaiah 49:5-6)—restoring Israel AND being a light to Gentiles aren't contradictory but complementary;
4. **Jesus ministered to Israel first** (Matthew 10:5-6; 15:24; Romans 1:16)—"Go nowhere among the Gentiles... but rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel"—before commissioning disciples to "make disciples of all nations" (Matthew 28:19);
5. **Israel's restoration happens through Messiah's Gentile mission** (Romans 11:11-26)—Gentile inclusion provokes Israel to jealousy, leading to national salvation: "all Israel will be saved" (Romans 11:26).

The pattern is Israel first, then Gentiles, then Israel's full restoration—all orchestrated by one Messiah in two stages (Acts 1:6-8; 3:19-21; 15:14-18).

**Isaiah Saw Christ's Glory.** Christians point to apostolic testimony that Isaiah's visions were specifically about Christ, not Israel collectively. The apostle John explicitly states:

> Though he [Jesus] had done so many signs before them, they still did not believe in him, so that the word spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled:
>
>> "Lord, who has believed what he heard from us, and to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed?" — Isaiah 53:1
>
> Therefore they could not believe. For again Isaiah said,
>
>> "He has blinded their eyes and hardened their heart, lest they see with their eyes, and understand with their heart, and turn, and I would heal them." — Isaiah 6:10
>
> Isaiah said these things because **he saw his glory and spoke of him**.
>
> — John 12:37-41 (ESV)

John declares that when Isaiah saw the Lord in the temple vision (Isaiah 6:1-5), he was actually seeing **Christ**. This is significant because:

1. **Individual, Not Collective**: If Isaiah saw Christ's personal glory in Isaiah 6 (around 740 BC), then Isaiah's subsequent prophecies—including the Servant Songs in Isaiah 42-53 — refer to this same individual Christ, not to Israel as a nation;

2. **Unified Interpretation**: John quotes both Isaiah 53:1 (the Suffering Servant passage) and Isaiah 6:10 (the temple vision), attributing both to Isaiah "seeing his [Christ's] glory"—demonstrating that the Servant prophecies concern the same divine figure Isaiah saw in the temple;

3. **Apostolic Authority**: This interpretation comes from John, **an eyewitness apostle who walked with Jesus**—his testimony that *"Isaiah said these things because he saw his [Christ's] glory"*;

4. **Another Public Divine Endorsement**: Additionally, John records another instance where God publicly spoke from heaven before crowds (beyond Matthew 3:17 and 17:5): when Jesus prayed "Father, glorify your name," a voice from heaven answered, "I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again"—and the crowd standing by heard it (John 12:28-29). This **public divine response demonstrates God's continued endorsement of Jesus's mission and identity**, even as Jesus approached his crucifixion.

### Teaching with Authority

#### Prophecy

Isaiah prophesied:

> All your children shall be **taught by the LORD**, and great shall be the peace of your children. — Isaiah 54:13 (ESV)

God himself would teach His people through the Messiah.

#### Fulfillment

Jesus applied this prophecy to himself:

> It is written in the Prophets, **"And they will all be taught by God."** Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me—not that anyone has seen the Father except he who is from God; he has seen the Father. — John 6:45-46 (ESV)

And after hearing Jesus teach, the crowds recognized this authority:

> And when Jesus finished these sayings, the crowds were astonished at his teaching, for **he was teaching them as one who had authority**, and not as their scribes. — Matthew 7:28-29 (ESV)

#### Jewish Perspective

**Not Considered Messianic.** Isaiah 54:13 is generally not viewed by Jews as a direct messianic prophecy. Jewish objections include: (1) **Context is national restoration**: Isaiah 54 describes Israel's restoration after exile—"your children" refers to the Jewish people being taught by God through prophets and Torah study, not through one individual Messiah; (2) **Already fulfilled**: Jews see this as fulfilled through the return from Babylonian exile, the rebuilding of Jerusalem, and the establishment of Torah education systems; (3) **Present reality**: Traditional Judaism emphasizes that all Jews are currently taught by God through Torah study, synagogue instruction, and rabbinic teaching—this is an ongoing reality, not awaiting messianic fulfillment; (4) **Misapplication**: Jesus' claim that people must "come to me" to be taught by the Father (John 6:45-46) is seen as adding to Scripture. The original text doesn't mention a mediator—it says people will be "taught by the LORD" directly through His word.

### Anointed to Proclaim Good News

#### Prophecy

Isaiah described the Messiah's ministry mission:

> **The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, because the LORD has anointed me to bring good news to the poor**; he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, **to proclaim liberty to the captives**, and the opening of the prison to those who are bound; to proclaim the year of the LORD’s favor, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all who mourn; — Isaiah 61:1-2 (ESV)

A ministry characterized by Spirit empowerment, good news to the poor, freedom for captives, and healing the brokenhearted.

#### Fulfillment

At the beginning of his ministry, Jesus read this passage in the Nazareth synagogue and declared its fulfillment:

> And the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was given to him. He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written, 
>
>> "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty those who are oppressed, to proclaim the year of the LORD's favor." 
>
> And he rolled up the scroll and gave it back to the attendant and sat down. And the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him. And he began to say to them, **"Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing."** 
> — Luke 4:17-21 (ESV)

Jesus explicitly claimed to fulfill Isaiah's prophecy and demonstrated it through healing, teaching, and liberation ministry.

#### Jewish Perspective

**Accepted as Messianic.** Isaiah 61:1-2 is recognized in Jewish tradition as describing either the prophet Isaiah's own mission or the future Messiah's work. 

However, Jews raise objections to Jesus' fulfillment: 
1. **Incomplete reading**: Jesus stopped mid-sentence at "the year of the LORD's favor" but didn't read the next phrase: "and the day of vengeance of our God" (Isaiah 61:2b). Jews argue the Messiah must fulfill the complete prophecy, including executing divine judgment; 
2. **Physical liberation**: "Liberty to the captives" is understood as literal release of Jewish exiles and prisoners, not merely spiritual freedom. During Jesus' time, Israel remained under Roman occupation; 
3. **National restoration**: The full context (Isaiah 61:3-11) describes Israel's national restoration, rebuilding of ruins (Isaiah 61:4), and recognition by all nations (Isaiah 61:11). Jews expect the Messiah to bring immediate national restoration upon his arrival, but during Jesus' time none of this occurred—Israel remained under Roman occupation and conditions deteriorated; 
4. **Permanent transformation**: The prophecy promises permanent changes ("they shall build up the ancient ruins"), but conditions in Israel worsened after Jesus, culminating in the temple's destruction in 70 AD.

#### Christian Perspective

Christians respond to these objections through a two-stage messianic fulfillment framework:

1. **Two-stage fulfillment**: Jesus' deliberate stopping point reveals two distinct comings. The "year of the LORD's favor" refers to his first coming as suffering servant, offering salvation and grace. The "day of vengeance of our God" points to his second coming as conquering king, executing final judgment. This explains why Jesus stopped mid-sentence—he was inaugurating the first phase, not the complete fulfillment;

2. **Spiritual primacy**: Christians view spiritual liberation as more fundamental than political freedom. Jesus freed humanity from sin, death, and spiritual bondage—a more profound captivity than Roman occupation. The Kingdom of God begins spiritually (Luke 17:21) and will be consummated physically at Christ's return;

3. **Already/not yet Kingdom**: The Kingdom has been inaugurated but not yet consummated. National restoration of Israel is expected at Christ's second coming (Romans 11:25-26). The church—composed of both Jews and Gentiles—represents the initial phase of restoration, fulfilling Isaiah's vision of God's people as "a light to the nations" (Isaiah 49:6);

4. **New covenant transformation**: The temple's destruction actually confirms Jesus' messianic identity. He prophesied its destruction (Matthew 24:2) and declared himself the new temple (John 2:19-21). The permanent transformation is spiritual: the new covenant replaces the old temple system (Hebrews 8-10), with believers corporately forming God's dwelling place (1 Corinthians 3:16).

This "already but not yet" framework allows Christians to affirm Jesus fulfilled Isaiah 61 at his first coming while anticipating complete fulfillment at his return.

### Messenger of the Covenant

#### Prophecy

Malachi, the last prophet of the Old Testament, prophesied about a messenger who would prepare the way for the Lord's coming:

> "Behold, **I send my messenger, and he will prepare the way before me**. And **the Lord whom you seek will suddenly come to his temple**; and **the messenger of the covenant** in whom you delight, behold, he is coming," says the LORD of hosts. "But who can endure the day of his coming, and who can stand when he appears? For he is like a refiner's fire and like fullers' soap. He will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he will purify the sons of Levi and refine them like gold and silver, and they will bring offerings in righteousness to the LORD. Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to the LORD as in the days of old and as in former years." — Malachi 3:1-4 (ESV)

This prophecy contains two distinct figures:
1. **The messenger who prepares the way**—a forerunner announcing the Messiah's arrival
2. **The Lord/messenger of the covenant**—the Messiah himself who would suddenly appear in the temple

#### Fulfillment

Jesus identified John the Baptist as the messenger who prepared his way:

> As they went away, Jesus began to speak to the crowds concerning John: "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind? What then did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Behold, those who wear soft clothing are in kings' houses. What then did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. **This is he of whom it is written, 'Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you.'** Truly, I say to you, among those born of women there has arisen no one greater than John the Baptist." — Matthew 11:7-11 (ESV)

Mark's gospel explicitly applies this prophecy to John the Baptist:

> The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. **As it is written in Isaiah the prophet, "Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way, the voice of one crying in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight,'"** John appeared, baptizing in the wilderness and proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. — Mark 1:1-4 (ESV)

Luke records similar testimony:

> When the messengers of John had gone, he began to speak to the crowds concerning John: "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind? What then did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Behold, those who are dressed in splendid clothing and live in luxury are in kings' courts. What then did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. **This is he of whom it is written, 'Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you.'**" — Luke 7:24-27 (ESV)

John the Baptist was the messenger who prepared the way, and Jesus came as the Lord—the messenger of the new covenant—who appeared in the temple and purified God's people through his sacrificial death.

#### Jewish Perspective

**Accepted as Messianic.** Malachi 3:1-4 is recognized in Jewish tradition as describing events before the Messiah's coming, though interpretations differ: (1) **Elijah as forerunner**: Jews expect the prophet Elijah to return before the Messiah (based on Malachi 4:5-6, which immediately follows this passage). They reject that John the Baptist fulfilled this because: (a) John explicitly denied being Elijah (John 1:21), (b) Elijah never died, so his return should be the same person, not someone "in the spirit of Elijah"; (2) **Temple purification unfulfilled**: Malachi describes the Lord coming to His temple and purifying the Levites so they can offer righteous sacrifices. Jesus didn't restore the Levitical priesthood or temple sacrifices—instead, these ended permanently in 70 AD after his death; (3) **Refiner's fire**: The prophecy speaks of purification "like a refiner's fire" producing righteous offerings to God. Jews argue this depicts a violent, obvious purification that didn't occur; (4) **New covenant problematic**: Christians interpret this as the "new covenant," but Jews argue God's covenant with Israel is eternal and irrevocable (Jeremiah 31:35-37), not replaceable.

## Divine Sonship and Priestly Office

### Divine Sonship Declared

#### Prophecy

Psalm 2 presents God's decree concerning His anointed king:

> I will tell of the decree: The LORD said to me, **"You are my Son; today I have begotten you**. Ask of me, and I will make the nations your heritage, and the ends of the earth your possession... Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and you perish in the way, for his wrath is quickly kindled. Blessed are all who take refuge in him." — Psalm 2:7-8, 12 (ESV)

The Messiah would be called God's **Son**, receive the *nations* as inheritance, and deserve *worship* ("Kiss the Son").

#### Fulfillment

Paul's sermon explicitly connected this to Jesus' resurrection:

> So Paul stood up, and motioning with his hand said: ... We bring you the good news that what God promised to the fathers, this He has fulfilled to us their children by raising Jesus, as also it is written in the second Psalm, **"You are My Son, today I have begotten you."** — Acts 13:16, 32-33 (ESV)

The "begetting" referred to resurrection—divine validation of Jesus as God's Son.

#### Jewish Perspective

**Debated Whether Messianic.** Psalm 2 is interpreted in various ways within Jewish tradition: (1) **King David or Solomon**: Many Jewish commentators see this as describing David's or Solomon's coronation. "You are my Son" is understood as adoption language—God declaring the Davidic king as His representative, not literal divine sonship. Ancient Near Eastern kings commonly used such "son of god" language metaphorically; (2) **Future Messiah**: Some rabbinic sources do apply this to the Messiah, but emphasize "Son" as a title of honor and authority, not deity. The Messiah will be fully human, a descendant of David; (3) **Coronation context**: "Today I have begotten you" refers to the day of coronation when the king assumes office, not biological birth or resurrection. Christians' application to resurrection is seen as eisegesis; (4) **Inheritance not yet realized**: The psalm promises "the nations as your heritage" and rule "to the ends of the earth"—Jews argue Jesus never received visible dominion over all nations, so the prophecy remains unfulfilled.

### The Lord at God's Right Hand

#### Prophecy

Psalm 110 presents a startling image—David calling his own descendant "Lord":

> The LORD *(YHWH)* says to my Lord: **"Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool**." The LORD sends forth from Zion your mighty scepter. Rule in the midst of your enemies! Your people will offer themselves freely on the day of your power, in holy garments; from the womb of the morning, the dew of your youth will be yours. The LORD has sworn and will not change his mind, **"You are a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek."** — Psalm 110:1-4 (ESV)

This Messiah would:
- Sit at God's right hand (position of supreme authority)
- Rule over enemies
- Serve as *eternal priest* (combining king and priest roles)

The Melchizedek reference is significant—this priesthood predates and transcends the Levitical system.

#### Fulfillment

Jesus used this psalm to challenge the Pharisees' understanding:

> Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question, saying, "What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?" They said to him, "The son of David." He said to them, "How is it then that David, in the Spirit, calls him Lord, saying, **'The LORD (YHVH) said to my Lord, sit at My right hand, until I put your enemies under your feet'?** If then David calls him Lord, how is he his son?" And no one was able to answer him a word. — Matthew 22:41-46 (ESV)

After his resurrection, Jesus ascended to this position:

> So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, **was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God**. — Mark 16:19 (ESV)

Peter testified:

> Being therefore exalted at the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this that you yourselves are seeing and hearing. For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he himself says, **"The Lord said to my Lord, 'Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool.'"** — Acts 2:33-35 (ESV)

Regarding the eternal priesthood:

> So also Christ did not exalt himself to be made a high priest, but was appointed by him who said to him, "You are my Son, today I have begotten you"; as he says also in another place, **"You are a priest forever, after the order of Melchizedek."** — Hebrews 5:5-6 (ESV)

Jesus serves as both king (Davidic line) and eternal priest (Melchizedek order)—a unique combination.

#### Jewish Perspective

**Debated Whether Messianic.** Psalm 110 presents interpretive challenges that divide Jewish scholars: (1) **David speaking about himself**: Some argue David wrote this as a prophetic psalm about his own kingship, using third-person language poetically; (2) **David about Abraham**: A rabbinic interpretation (Midrash) suggests David is speaking about Abraham—"The LORD said to my lord [Abraham]"—referring to Genesis 14 where Melchizedek blessed Abraham; (3) **Military/political context**: The psalm emphasizes military conquest ("make your enemies your footstool," "shatter kings"), which Jews argue Jesus never fulfilled. The Messiah should achieve visible political victory; (4) **Melchizedek priesthood problematic**: Jews reject the concept of a non-Levitical priesthood for the Messiah. The Torah establishes the Aaronic/Levitical priesthood as eternal (Exodus 40:15; Numbers 25:13). Introducing a different priestly order contradicts the irrevocability of God's covenant with Aaron; (5) **"My Lord" explained differently**: Some Jewish interpretations say David is addressing his own descendants or speaking prophetically about the Messiah without implying deity—"my lord" (adoni) means "my master," a term of respect, not divinity (vs. Adonai, the divine name).

### Leader Who Approaches God

#### Prophecy

Jeremiah prophesied about a unique leader with unprecedented access to God:

> Their prince shall be one of themselves; their ruler shall come out from their midst. **I will make him draw near, and he shall approach me, for who would dare of himself to approach me?** declares the LORD. — Jeremiah 30:21 (ESV)

This prophecy raises a profound question: Who would dare approach the holy God? Under the Mosaic covenant, only the high priest could enter God's presence once a year in the Most Holy Place, and that with great fear (Leviticus 16). Yet Jeremiah foretells a Jewish leader who would have unique authorization to approach God directly.

#### Fulfillment

Jesus Christ serves as our great high priest who has opened the way for all believers to approach God:

> Since then we have a great **high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God**, let us hold fast our confession. For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin. **Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace**, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need. — Hebrews 4:14-16 (ESV)

> Consequently, **he is able to save to the uttermost those who draw near to God through him, since he always lives to make intercession for them**. — Hebrews 7:25 (ESV)

Through Jesus' sacrificial death, the curtain separating humanity from God was torn, granting believers direct access:

> Therefore, brothers, since **we have confidence to enter the holy places by the blood of Jesus**, by the new and living way that he opened for us through the curtain, that is, through his flesh, and since we have a great priest over the house of God, **let us draw near with a true heart** in full assurance of faith. — Hebrews 10:19-22 (ESV)

Jesus is the leader who dared approach God—and through him, we too can approach the throne of grace with confidence.

#### Jewish Perspective

**Not Considered Messianic.** Jeremiah 30:21 is generally not viewed by Jews as a messianic prophecy. Jewish interpretations include: (1) **Historical context**: Jeremiah 30 describes Israel's restoration from Babylonian exile. "Their prince" refers to post-exilic Jewish leaders like Zerubbabel or the future restored Davidic monarchy in general, not a specific Messiah; (2) **Corporate leader, not high priest**: The verse describes a political "prince" and "ruler" from among the people—Jews don't see this as establishing a new priestly role. The high priest already had the right and duty to approach God; this verse doesn't describe something unique; (3) **Question is rhetorical**: "Who would dare of himself to approach me?" emphasizes that no one approaches God presumptuously—only those whom God authorizes. Under the Mosaic covenant, the high priest had this authorization. The verse isn't predicting a new kind of mediator; (4) **Already fulfilled**: Jews see this as fulfilled through the Levitical priesthood and prophetic leaders throughout Israel's history. There's no need for a future fulfillment through Jesus or anyone else.

### Foundation Stone in Zion

#### Prophecy

Isaiah prophesied about a precious cornerstone that God would establish:

> Therefore thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, **I am the one who has laid as a foundation in Zion, a stone, a tested stone, a precious cornerstone, of a sure foundation**: 'Whoever believes will not be in haste.'" — Isaiah 28:16 (ESV)

This foundation stone would be:
- **Laid by God himself** in Zion (Jerusalem)
- **Tested and proven**—reliable and trustworthy
- **Precious**—of immense value
- **A sure foundation**—unshakeable
- The basis for **faith**—"whoever believes"

The cornerstone metaphor is architectural—the first stone laid, determining the position and alignment of the entire building.

#### Fulfillment

Paul explicitly applied this prophecy to Jesus Christ and salvation through faith:

> Brothers, my heart's desire and prayer to God for them is that they may be saved... For, being ignorant of the righteousness of God, and seeking to establish their own, they did not submit to God's righteousness. For **Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes**.
>
> For Moses writes about the righteousness that is based on the law, that the person who does the commandments shall live by them. But the righteousness based on faith says... if **you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved**. For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved. For the Scripture says, **"Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame."** — Romans 10:1, 3-11 (ESV)

Peter also identified Jesus as the cornerstone:

> For it stands in Scripture: **"Behold, I am laying in Zion a stone, a cornerstone chosen and precious, and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame."** So the honor is for you who believe, but for those who do not believe, "The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone," and "A stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense." They stumble because they disobey the word, as they were destined to do. — 1 Peter 2:6-8 (ESV)

And Paul wrote to the Ephesian church:

> So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God, **built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone**, in whom the whole structure, being joined together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord. — Ephesians 2:19-20 (ESV)

Jesus Christ is the foundation stone—the cornerstone upon which God builds His church. Everyone who believes in him will never be put to shame.

#### Jewish Perspective

**Not Considered Messianic.** Isaiah 28:16 is not typically interpreted by Jews as referring to the Messiah. Jewish perspectives include: (1) **Historical context**: Isaiah 28 addresses the leaders of Ephraim (Northern Kingdom) and their false confidence. The "cornerstone" metaphor represents God's faithful remnant, the righteous community in Zion, or the city of Jerusalem itself—not an individual person; (2) **Already fulfilled**: Some interpret this as already fulfilled in King Hezekiah's time or through the return from Babylonian exile when Jerusalem was rebuilt. The "foundation in Zion" is the restored city and community; (3) **Torah as foundation**: Some rabbinic interpretations identify the "precious cornerstone" as the Torah, which is the foundation of Jewish faith and practice. "Whoever believes" refers to trust in God's word and commandments; (4) **Context about judgment**: The immediate context (Isaiah 28:14-22) warns against making covenants with death and seeking refuge in lies. The "stone" represents God's true standard by which He will measure Israel—this is about divine judgment criteria, not the Messiah; (5) **No suffering mentioned**: Unlike Isaiah 53, this passage contains no reference to suffering, sacrifice, or atonement—key messianic themes Christians emphasize elsewhere.

## The Suffering Servant (Isaiah 52-53)

Isaiah 52-53 presents the most detailed prophecy of the Messiah's suffering. Written ~700 years before Jesus, it describes his mission with stunning precision. Let's examine each element with its fulfillment.

### Jewish Perspective on Isaiah 52-53 (Overview)

**Predominantly Rejected as Messianic/Individual.** Isaiah 52-53 represents the most significant interpretive divide between Judaism and Christianity. The traditional Jewish interpretation differs fundamentally from the Christian view:

**(1) The Servant is Israel, not an individual Messiah**: Throughout Isaiah, God repeatedly identifies His "servant" as the nation of Israel collectively (Isaiah 41:8-9; 44:1-2, 21; 45:4; 49:3; 52:13). Jews argue Isaiah 53 continues this theme—the suffering servant is the Jewish people who suffered exile, persecution, and martyrdom throughout history, bearing the sins of the nations metaphorically by enduring unjust punishment.

**(2) Israel's suffering among the nations**: The speaker in Isaiah 53:1-9 ("we," "our") represents the Gentile nations who oppressed Israel, now confessing they misunderstood Israel's suffering. They thought Israel was punished by God for its own sins, but now realize Israel suffered innocently while the nations were the true sinners. This interpretation sees Isaiah 53 as a prophecy about how Gentiles will eventually recognize their mistreatment of the Jewish people.

**(3) Messianic expectations don't include suffering**: Traditional Jewish eschatology expects the Messiah to be a victorious military and political leader who will: rebuild the Temple, gather all Jews to Israel, bring world peace, end all oppression, and cause all nations to acknowledge the God of Israel. A suffering, dying Messiah contradicts these expectations. Jews argue that if Jesus were the Messiah, these conditions would have been fulfilled immediately.

**(4) Resurrection not clearly described**: Jews contend that Isaiah 53:10-12 ("he shall prolong his days," "he shall see his offspring") doesn't clearly predict resurrection but rather describes Israel's national survival and future restoration despite near-destruction.

**(5) Context of chapters 40-66**: Isaiah 40-66 repeatedly speaks of Israel's redemption from Babylonian exile and future restoration. Jews argue interpreting chapter 53 as about an individual Messiah ignores the consistent theme of national redemption throughout these chapters.

**(6) Post-Temple interpretation shift**: Some Jews acknowledge that ancient Jewish sources (pre-70 AD) sometimes applied Isaiah 53 to the Messiah, but after the destruction of the Second Temple and the rise of Christianity, rabbinic interpretation shifted to emphasize the collective Israel interpretation as a response to Christian claims.

Each specific prophecy within Isaiah 52-53 is understood through this framework of corporate, national interpretation rather than individual, messianic fulfillment.

### Exalted Yet Disfigured

#### Prophecy

> Behold, **my servant shall act wisely; he shall be high and lifted up**, and shall be exalted. As many were astonished at you—**his appearance was so marred, beyond human semblance**, and his form beyond that of the children of mankind—so shall he sprinkle many nations. Kings shall shut their mouths because of him. — Isaiah 52:13-15 (ESV)

The Messiah would be both *exalted* and *disfigured*—glory through suffering.

#### Fulfillment

Jesus was exalted through resurrection and ascension, but only after brutal suffering during crucifixion—his appearance marred by scourging, beating, and crucifixion wounds.

### No External Beauty

#### Prophecy

> Who has believed what he has heard from us? And to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed? For he grew up before him like a young plant, and like a root out of dry ground; **he had no form or majesty that we should look at him, and no beauty that we should desire him**. — Isaiah 53:1-2 (ESV)

No external beauty or royal appearance—easily overlooked.

#### Fulfillment

Jesus grew up in humble circumstances, not in a palace. He was a carpenter's son from Nazareth, a town so insignificant it provoked the question: "Can anything good come out of Nazareth?" (John 1:46).

### Despised and Rejected

#### Prophecy

> **He was despised and rejected by men, a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief**; and as one from whom men hide their faces he was despised, and we esteemed him not. Surely **he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows**; yet we esteemed him stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted. — Isaiah 53:3-4 (ESV)

Social rejection and suffering on behalf of others.

#### Fulfillment

> He came to his own, and **his own people did not receive him**. — John 1:11 (ESV)

Even his brothers didn't believe:

> For not even his brothers believed in him. — John 7:5 (ESV)

The Jewish leaders sought to kill him:

> So the Jews sought all the more to kill him, because not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God. — John 5:18 (ESV)

### Pierced for Our Transgressions

#### Prophecy

> But **he was pierced for our transgressions; he was crushed for our iniquities**; upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace, and **with his wounds we are healed**. All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned—every one—to his own way; and **the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all**. — Isaiah 53:5-6 (ESV)

**Vicarious atonement**—he suffers *for* our sins, not his own. His wounds bring *our* healing.

#### Fulfillment

Jesus was literally pierced—nails through hands and feet, spear through side:

> Then he said to Thomas, "Put your finger here, and see **my hands**; and put out your hand, and place it in **my side**. Do not disbelieve, but believe." — John 20:27 (ESV)

> But one of the soldiers **pierced his side with a spear**, and at once there came out blood and water. — John 19:34 (ESV)

Paul explained the vicarious nature:

> For our sake he [God] made him [Jesus] **to be sin who knew no sin**, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God. — 2 Corinthians 5:21 (ESV)

### Silent Before Accusers

#### Prophecy

> He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, **yet he opened not his mouth**; **like a lamb that is led to the slaughter**, and like a sheep that before its shearers is silent, so he opened not his mouth. By oppression and judgment he was taken away; and as for his generation, who considered that he was cut off out of the land of the living, **stricken for the transgression of my people**? — Isaiah 53:7-8 (ESV)

Silent before accusers, led to slaughter, executed unjustly.

#### Fulfillment

> Now Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus said, "You have said so." But when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, **he gave no answer**. Then Pilate said to him, "Do you not hear how many things they testify against you?" But **he gave him no answer, not even to a single charge**, so that the governor was greatly amazed. — Matthew 27:11-14 (ESV)

Before Herod:

> So he questioned him at some length, but **he made no answer**. — Luke 23:9 (ESV)

### Buried with Wicked, Yet in Rich Man's Tomb

#### Prophecy

> And they made **his grave with the wicked and with a rich man in his death**, although **he had done no violence, and there was no deceit in his mouth**. Yet it was the will of the LORD to crush him; he has put him to grief; **when his soul makes an offering for guilt**, he shall see his offspring; he shall prolong his days; the will of the LORD shall prosper in his hand. — Isaiah 53:9-10 (ESV)

Buried with the wicked yet in a *rich man's tomb*. Sinless yet treated as a *guilt offering*. And remarkably—*he shall prolong his days* (life after death).

#### Fulfillment

**Buried with wicked:**
Jesus was crucified between two criminals:

> And with him they crucified **two robbers, one on his right and one on his left**. — Mark 15:27 (ESV)

**Yet in rich man's tomb:**

> When it was evening, there came **a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph**, who also was a disciple of Jesus. He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him. And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen shroud and **laid it in his own new tomb**, which he had cut in the rock. And he rolled a great stone to the entrance of the tomb and went away. — Matthew 27:57-60 (ESV)

**Sinless:**

> He committed no sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth. — 1 Peter 2:22 (ESV)

Even his enemies couldn't identify any sin:

> Which one of you convicts me of sin? — John 8:46 (ESV)

Pilate declared:

> I find no guilt in this man. — Luke 23:4 (ESV)

### Makes Many Righteous, Numbered with Transgressors

#### Prophecy

> Out of the anguish of his soul he shall see and be satisfied; by his knowledge shall the righteous one, my servant, **make many to be accounted righteous**, and he shall bear their iniquities. Therefore I will divide him a portion with the many, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong, because he poured out his soul to death and **was numbered with the transgressors**; yet **he bore the sin of many, and makes intercession for the transgressors**. — Isaiah 53:11-12 (ESV)

The Servant *makes many righteous* through bearing their sins. Counted among criminals yet interceding for sinners.

#### Fulfillment

Jesus himself cited this prophecy:

> For I tell you that this Scripture must be fulfilled in me: **"And he was numbered with the transgressors."** For what is written about me has its fulfillment. — Luke 22:37 (ESV)

And it happened—crucified between criminals:

> And with him they crucified **two robbers, one on his right and one on his left**. — Mark 15:27 (ESV)

## Crucifixion Foretold (Psalm 22)

Written by David ~1000 years before crucifixion was invented, Psalm 22 describes execution by crucifixion with eerie precision. Let's examine each element.

### Jewish Perspective on Psalm 22 (Overview)

**Not Considered Messianic/Prophetic.** Jewish interpretation of Psalm 22 differs fundamentally from the Christian messianic reading:

**(1) David's personal lament**: Jews view Psalm 22 as David's own psalm describing his personal suffering during persecution—possibly when fleeing from King Saul or during Absalom's rebellion. It's a prayer of anguish by a righteous sufferer, not a prophecy about the Messiah centuries later. The psalm expresses David's feelings of abandonment and his enemies' mockery, then transitions to praise when God delivers him.

**(2) Genre: individual lament, not prophecy**: Psalm 22 belongs to the genre of individual lament psalms (like Psalms 3, 13, 22, 69). These psalms follow a pattern: complaint → description of suffering → confidence in God → thanksgiving/praise. Jews argue Christians mistakenly read prophetic significance into what is simply poetic description of human suffering and divine deliverance.

**(3) Crucifixion language explained differently**:
- **"Pierced my hands and feet" (v.16)**: The Hebrew text is disputed. The Masoretic Text reads "ka'ari" (כָּאֲרִי) meaning "like a lion [at my hands and feet]," not "pierced" (which would be "karu" - כָּרוּ). Jews argue Christians rely on the Septuagint mistranslation. Even if "pierced" is correct, it could describe David feeling surrounded by enemies "like lions" tearing at him, or soldiers binding his hands and feet, not crucifixion.
- **"Divide my garments" (v.18)**: Ancient Near Eastern victors commonly plundered the defeated. This describes David's enemies prematurely dividing his possessions, assuming he'll die. It's not predicting Roman soldiers casting lots 1000 years later.

**(4) Psalm ends in triumph**: Verses 22-31 describe deliverance, praise, and future generations worshiping God. Jews argue this fits David's life (God delivered him from enemies) but doesn't fit Jesus, who died and didn't experience earthly deliverance at the time of crucifixion.

**(5) Jesus quoted Psalm 22 as prayer, not fulfillment**: Jews acknowledge Jesus quoted Psalm 22:1 on the cross, but argue he was simply praying a familiar psalm of lament in his suffering—not declaring messianic fulfillment. Devout Jews regularly recite psalms in times of distress; this doesn't make every quoted psalm a prophecy about that person.

**(6) Retroactive interpretation**: Jews argue Christians read crucifixion details back into Psalm 22 only after Jesus' death, seeing connections that aren't inherently prophetic but rather reflect common features of ancient torture and execution.

Each specific element of Psalm 22 is understood through this framework of Davidic personal experience, poetic hyperbole, and lament genre—not prophetic prediction of crucifixion.

### Cry of Forsakenness

#### Prophecy

> **My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?** — Psalm 22:1 (ESV)

#### Fulfillment

> And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, "Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?" that is, **"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"** — Matthew 27:46 (ESV)

Jesus quoted Psalm 22's opening words on the cross—experiencing the spiritual anguish David prophetically described.

### Mocking Words

#### Prophecy

> All who see me mock me; they make mouths at me; they wag their heads; **"He trusts in the LORD; let him deliver him; let him rescue him, for he delights in him!"** — Psalm 22:7-8 (ESV)

#### Fulfillment

> And those who passed by derided him, wagging their heads and saying, "You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross." So also the chief priests, with the scribes and elders, mocked him, saying, "He saved others; he cannot save himself. He is the King of Israel; let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him. **He trusts in God; let God deliver him now, if he desires him**. For he said, 'I am the Son of God.'" — Matthew 27:39-43 (ESV)

The mockers unknowingly quoted Psalm 22 verbatim.

### Pierced Hands and Feet

#### Prophecy

> For dogs encompass me; a company of evildoers encircles me; **they have pierced my hands and feet**—I can count all my bones—they stare and gloat over me. — Psalm 22:16-17 (ESV)

"Pierced my hands and feet" describes crucifixion—a Roman execution method not invented when David wrote this (~1000 BC).

#### Fulfillment

Crucifixion involved nails through hands and feet. After resurrection, Jesus showed the wounds:

> Then he said to Thomas, "Put your finger here, and see **my hands**; and put out your hand, and place it in my side. Do not disbelieve, but believe." — John 20:27 (ESV)

Thomas could see and touch the nail wounds in Jesus' hands.

### Garments Divided by Casting Lots

#### Prophecy

> **They divide my garments among them, and for my clothing they cast lots**. — Psalm 22:18 (ESV)

#### Fulfillment

> And when they had crucified him, **they divided his garments among them by casting lots**. — Matthew 27:35 (ESV)

John provides more detail:

> When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his garments and divided them into four parts, one part for each soldier; also his tunic. But the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom, so they said to one another, "Let us not tear it, but **cast lots for it to see whose it shall be**." This was to fulfill the Scripture which says, "They divided my garments among them, and for my clothing they cast lots." — John 19:23-24 (ESV)

## Specific Events of Passion Week

### Triumphal Entry on a Donkey

#### Prophecy

Zechariah foresaw the Messiah's entry into Jerusalem:

> Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! Shout aloud, O daughter of Jerusalem! Behold, **your king is coming to you; righteous and having salvation is he, humble and mounted on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey**. — Zechariah 9:9 (ESV)

A king entering Jerusalem—not on a warhorse, but humbly on a donkey.

#### Fulfillment

> The next day the large crowd that had come to the feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem. So they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him, crying out, "Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel!" And Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it, just as it is written, **"Fear not, daughter of Zion; behold, your king is coming, sitting on a donkey's colt!"** — John 12:12-16 (ESV)

#### Jewish Perspective

**Accepted as Messianic, but unfulfilled.** Zechariah 9:9 is widely recognized by Jews as describing the Messiah's arrival. However, Jews argue Jesus' entry into Jerusalem doesn't constitute fulfillment because: (1) **Context requires complete fulfillment**: Zechariah 9:9-10 promises that this king will "speak peace to the nations" and "his rule shall be from sea to sea." Jesus didn't establish peace or worldwide rule; (2) **Military victory missing**: Zechariah 9:10 says "he shall cut off the chariot from Ephraim and the war horse from Jerusalem"—depicting disarmament because peace is established. War continued after Jesus' entry; (3) **Humble entry, but what followed?**: The donkey signifies the Messiah comes in peace, not war—but this should be followed by actual peace and kingdom establishment. Jesus entered Jerusalem but was executed days later; (4) **Temporary, not permanent**: The crowd's recognition was fleeting—within a week they were calling for his crucifixion. The Messiah's arrival should result in permanent, undeniable transformation. Jews expect the Messiah will fulfill Zechariah 9:9-10 completely in one coming, not partially across two comings separated by millennia.

### Betrayed for Thirty Pieces of Silver

#### Prophecy

Zechariah recorded a symbolic act involving a specific price:

> Then I said to them, "If it seems good to you, give me my wages; but if not, keep them." And they weighed out as my wages **thirty pieces of silver**. — Zechariah 11:12 (ESV)

Thirty silver pieces (the price of a slave)—a contemptuous valuation.

#### Fulfillment

> Then one of the twelve, whose name was Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests and said, "What will you give me if I deliver him over to you?" And **they paid him thirty pieces of silver**. — Matthew 26:14-15 (ESV)

The exact amount Zechariah predicted.

#### Jewish Perspective

**Not Considered Messianic.** Zechariah 11:4-17 is interpreted by Jews as prophetic theater, not messianic prophecy. Jewish perspectives include: (1) **Symbolic action drama**: Zechariah acts out God's relationship with Israel using shepherd imagery. The "thirty pieces of silver" represents God's contemptuous payment for His rejected care of Israel—it's the price of a slave (Exodus 21:32), showing how little Israel valued God's shepherding; (2) **Historical context**: This passage describes events in Zechariah's own time or the immediate future (pre-exilic or post-exilic period), not the Messiah 500+ years later. The "shepherds" are Israel's leaders who failed the people; (3) **No messianic markers**: The passage contains no reference to the Messiah, Davidic king, salvation, or redemption—only judgment on Israel for rejecting God's care; (4) **Coincidental details**: Jews argue the thirty silver pieces and potter imagery coincidentally matched Judas' betrayal, but this doesn't make it prophecy. Ancient Israel commonly used silver for payments, and potters were common tradesmen; (5) **Matthew's interpretation creative**: Matthew's citation combines elements from both Zechariah 11:12-13 and Jeremiah 18-19 (pottery), attributing it to "Jeremiah" (Matthew 27:9)—Jews see this as Matthew creatively connecting unrelated passages to find prophetic significance post-facto.

### Money Thrown in Temple, Used for Potter's Field

#### Prophecy

> Then the LORD said to me, "**Throw it to the potter**"—the lordly price at which I was priced by them. So I took the thirty pieces of silver and **threw them into the house of the LORD, to the potter**. — Zechariah 11:13 (ESV)

#### Fulfillment

> Then when Judas, his betrayer, saw that Jesus was condemned, he changed his mind and **brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests** and the elders, saying, "I have sinned by betraying innocent blood." They said, "What is that to us? See to it yourself." And **throwing down the pieces of silver into the temple**, he departed, and he went and hanged himself. But the chief priests, taking the pieces of silver, said, "It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is blood money." So they took counsel and **bought with them the potter's field** as a burial place for strangers. — Matthew 27:3-7 (ESV)

Thirty silver pieces, thrown into the temple, used to buy a potter's field—precisely as Zechariah wrote.

### Disciples Scattered

#### Prophecy

Zechariah prophesied:

> "Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, against the man who stands next to me," declares the LORD of hosts. **"Strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered**; I will turn my hand against the little ones." — Zechariah 13:7 (ESV)

When the shepherd is struck, his followers scatter.

#### Fulfillment

Jesus quoted this prophecy before his arrest:

> And Jesus said to them, "You will all fall away, for it is written, **'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.'"** — Mark 14:27 (ESV)

And it happened:

> Then all the disciples **left him and fled**. — Matthew 26:56 (ESV)

#### Jewish Perspective

**Not Considered Messianic.** Jewish interpretation of Zechariah 13:7 differs significantly from the Christian messianic reading: (1) **Context of false prophets**: Zechariah 13 begins with a discussion of removing false prophets and unclean spirits from Israel (verses 1-6). Verse 7's "sword against my shepherd" refers to God's judgment on Israel's unfaithful leaders, not the Messiah; (2) **God striking His shepherd**: The phrase "Strike the shepherd" depicts divine judgment. Jews argue God would not strike the Messiah, who is supposed to be righteous and victorious. This contradicts messianic expectations; (3) **Scattered sheep = Israel's judgment**: The scattering describes Israel going into exile or experiencing dispersion as judgment for following false shepherds—this happened in 586 BC (Babylonian exile) and 70 AD (Roman destruction). It's not about disciples fleeing; (4) **Zechariah 13:8-9 describes national judgment**: The verses immediately following describe two-thirds of the people being cut off and one-third refined through fire. This clearly refers to national calamity (the Babylonian conquest or later Roman destruction), not twelve disciples scattering during Jesus' arrest; (5) **Jesus' quote doesn't prove prophecy**: Jews acknowledge Jesus quoted this verse (Mark 14:27) but argue he was applying a Scripture about Israel's judgment to his own situation—similar to how people today might quote a psalm. Quoting a verse doesn't retroactively make it a prophecy about that person.

### Pierced Side

#### Prophecy

Zechariah saw a future mourning over one who was pierced:

> And I will pour out on the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem a spirit of compassion and supplication, so that, **when they look on him whom they have pierced, they shall mourn for him**, as one mourns for an only child, and weep bitterly over him, as one weeps over a firstborn. — Zechariah 12:10 (ESV)

#### Fulfillment

> But one of the soldiers **pierced his side with a spear**, and at once there came out blood and water. He who saw it has borne witness—his testimony is true, and he knows that he is telling the truth—that you also may believe. For these things took place that the Scripture might be fulfilled: "Not one of his bones will be broken." And again another Scripture says, **"They will look on him whom they have pierced."** — John 19:34-37 (ESV)

#### Jewish Perspective

**Debated Whether Messianic.** Zechariah 12:10 presents interpretive challenges: (1) **Context: military victory over nations**: Zechariah 12 describes Jerusalem's future deliverance when God defeats all attacking nations. The "piercing" occurs in the context of warfare—Jews interpret this as referring to a Jewish military leader or martyr killed in battle defending Jerusalem, whom the survivors will mourn. This hasn't happened yet; it's still future; (2) **"Me whom they have pierced" vs. "him"**: The Hebrew text is ambiguous—"they shall look on me whom they have pierced" could mean God is speaking (how can God be pierced?), or it could be emended to "him whom they have pierced," referring to a human figure. Some Jewish translations read "they shall look to me concerning him whom they pierced"—mourning over a fallen leader while looking to God; (3) **National mourning, not individual**: The mourning described involves "every family by itself" (12:12-14), depicting national lamentation. Jews see this as future mourning over Jewish casualties in end-times battles, not mourning over the Messiah; (4) **Messiah ben Joseph tradition**: Some Jewish sources speak of "Messiah son of Joseph" (a precursor to Messiah son of David) who will be killed in battle before the final Messiah arrives. This is a minority view and post-dates the New Testament; (5) **Piercing is warfare, not crucifixion**: The Hebrew word "daqar" means "pierce" or "thrust through" with a sword or spear in battle—it describes military death, not crucifixion. The Roman soldier's spear thrust at Jesus' death doesn't fit the context of Zechariah 12's eschatological battle.

## Resurrection and Exaltation

### The Seed of the Woman

#### Prophecy

The first messianic prophecy appears immediately after the Fall, when God addresses the serpent (Satan):

> I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring; **he shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel**. — Genesis 3:15 (ESV)

This is known as the *protoevangelium* (first gospel)—the earliest promise of a coming Redeemer. Note the striking details:

- **"Her offspring"** (seed of the woman)—unusual phrasing, since lineage typically traced through fathers. This hints at the virgin birth.
- **"He shall bruise your head"**—a fatal blow to Satan's authority
- **"You shall bruise his heel"**—a painful but non-fatal wound to the Messiah

The prophecy predicts cosmic conflict between Satan and the Messiah, resulting in Satan's defeat and the Messiah's suffering.

#### Fulfillment

Jesus explicitly identified Satan as humanity's spiritual enemy:

> You are of your father the devil, and your will is to do your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. — John 8:44 (ESV)

Paul declared Satan's impending final defeat:

> The God of peace will soon **crush Satan under your feet**. — Romans 16:20 (ESV)

The author of Hebrews explained how Jesus' death destroyed Satan's power:

> Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise partook of the same things, that **through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil**, and deliver all those who through fear of death were subject to lifelong slavery. — Hebrews 2:14-15 (ESV)

Through his crucifixion (heel bruised) and resurrection, Jesus dealt the fatal blow to Satan's authority (head crushed), fulfilling the first promise of redemption.

#### Jewish Perspective

**Not Considered Messianic.** Genesis 3:15 is not interpreted by Jews as a messianic prophecy. Jewish perspectives include: (1) **Literal: humans vs. snakes**: The most straightforward Jewish reading sees this as explaining the natural enmity between humans and snakes—humans fear snakes and try to crush their heads, while snakes strike at humans' heels. It's etiological (explaining origins), not prophetic; (2) **Ongoing struggle with evil**: Some interpret the serpent as representing evil inclination (yetzer hara) or evil forces in general. The "seed of the woman" is humanity collectively struggling against evil throughout history—not a specific individual Messiah; (3) **No "he" in Hebrew**: The Hebrew pronoun is "hu" which can be translated "he," "it," or "they" depending on context. Since "seed" (zera) is collective, it could mean "they [humanity/Israel] shall bruise your head." There's no indication of a singular male descendant; (4) **Virgin birth reading rejected**: Christians emphasize "seed of the woman" as hinting at virgin birth (seed without a father). Jews see no such implication—the phrase simply describes human descendants generally, as Eve is the mother of all humanity; (5) **No resurrection mentioned**: The "bruised heel" vs. "crushed head" distinction doesn't clearly predict death and resurrection. Both parties are injured; one wound is more serious, but that doesn't imply one party dies and rises again; (6) **No Satan concept here**: Genesis 3 depicts a literal serpent (though crafty). The equation serpent = Satan comes from later Christian theology (Revelation 12:9), not from Genesis itself or Jewish interpretation.

### Not Abandoned to the Grave

#### Prophecy

David wrote prophetically:

> For you will not abandon my soul to Sheol, **or let your holy one see corruption**. You make known to me the path of life; in your presence there is fullness of joy; at your right hand are pleasures forevermore. — Psalm 16:10-11 (ESV)

The Holy One would not experience bodily decay—implying resurrection before decomposition.

#### Fulfillment

The apostle Peter preached at Pentecost:

> Brothers, I may say to you with confidence about the patriarch David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day. Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would set one of his descendants on his throne, **he foresaw and spoke about the resurrection of the Christ**, that he was not abandoned to Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption. **This Jesus God raised up, and of that we all are witnesses**. — Acts 2:29-32 (ESV)

Jesus rose from the dead before his body could decay—fulfilling David's prophecy.

#### Jewish Perspective

**Not Considered Messianic.** Psalm 16 is viewed by Jews as David's personal expression of trust in God, not a resurrection prophecy. Jewish objections include: (1) **David speaking about himself**: The entire psalm is first-person ("my," "me," "I")—David expressing confidence that God will protect him from death during his lifetime. "You will not abandon my soul to Sheol" means God will deliver him from mortal danger, not that he'll resurrect after dying; (2) **Sheol doesn't mean hell**: In Hebrew thought, Sheol is the grave or the realm of the dead—everyone goes there when they die (Genesis 37:35; Job 14:13). "Not abandon to Sheol" means "preserve from death" or "rescue from dying," not "resurrect after death"; (3) **"See corruption" means "experience death"**: The phrase "nor let your holy one see corruption" means "don't let me die" or "protect me from decay while alive." It's a prayer for protection from premature death, not a prediction of resurrection; (4) **David's confidence fulfilled**: God did protect David from many dangers throughout his life (Saul, Absalom, enemies). The psalm was fulfilled in David's own experience; (5) **No resurrection expectation**: Jewish theology during David's time didn't have a developed resurrection doctrine. That came later (Daniel 12:2; Maccabean period). David wasn't prophesying about resurrection; (6) **Peter's interpretation creative**: Jews acknowledge Peter applied this to Jesus (Acts 2:29-32) but see this as creative Christian reinterpretation, not the psalm's original meaning. Peter's argument that "David died and was buried" proves he wasn't speaking about himself doesn't account for the fact that David was expressing confidence God would preserve him from death—which God did during David's lifetime.

### Resurrection on the Third Day

#### Prophecy

While Hosea 6:2 in context refers to Israel ("After two days he will revive us; on the third day he will raise us up"), Jesus applied the "third day" pattern to himself:

> And he began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed, and **after three days rise again**. — Mark 8:31 (ESV)

#### Fulfillment

> Now after the Sabbath, toward the dawn of the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb... But the angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified. **He is not here, for he has risen**, as he said." — Matthew 28:1, 5-6 (ESV)

Jesus rose on the third day:
- Crucified: Friday (Day 1)
- In tomb: Saturday (Day 2)
- Risen: Sunday (Day 3)

#### Jewish Perspective

**Not Considered Messianic.** Hosea 6:2 is not interpreted by Jews as a messianic prophecy about resurrection. Jewish perspectives include: (1) **Context: Israel's national restoration**: Hosea 6:1-3 is Israel's call to repentance after God's judgment. "After two days... on the third day" is metaphorical language about Israel's restoration from exile—the nation will be "revived" after a brief period of punishment. It describes national restoration, not individual resurrection; (2) **"Days" are figurative periods**: The "two days" and "third day" represent short, indefinite periods of time—not literal 24-hour days. In prophetic literature, "day" often symbolizes an era or period (e.g., "day of the LORD"). The point is that God's restoration will come quickly, not that someone will resurrect on day three; (3) **Already fulfilled**: This prophecy was fulfilled when Israel returned from Babylonian exile after ~70 years (a "short time" in covenant history). The nation was "revived" and "raised up" when they rebuilt Jerusalem and the temple; (4) **No individual in view**: The pronouns are plural—"us," "we"—clearly referring to the people of Israel collectively, not one person. Nothing in the context suggests an individual Messiah; (5) **Jesus' application not in text**: While Jesus predicted his resurrection on the third day (Mark 8:31), he didn't explicitly cite Hosea 6:2. The "third day" detail became significant to Christians post-resurrection, but this doesn't make Hosea 6:2 a prophecy about it; (6) **Pattern vs. prophecy**: Even if there's a "third day" pattern in Scripture (Genesis 22:4; Exodus 19:11, 16; Hosea 6:2), this doesn't make each instance a prophecy of Jesus' resurrection. It's a common biblical motif for divine action, not a specific prediction.

### Ascended to God's Right Hand

#### Prophecy

As noted earlier, Psalm 110:1 prophesied:

> The LORD says to my Lord: **"Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool."**

#### Fulfillment

> So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, **was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God**. — Mark 16:19 (ESV)

Peter testified:

> Being therefore exalted at the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this that you yourselves are seeing and hearing. For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he himself says, **"The Lord said to my Lord, 'Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool.'"** — Acts 2:33-35 (ESV)

*(See earlier Jewish Perspective on Psalm 110:1 in the Divine Sonship and Priestly Office section)*

### Given All Authority

#### Prophecy

Daniel's apocalyptic vision foretold universal dominion:

> I saw in the night visions, and behold, with the clouds of heaven there came **one like a son of man**, and he came to the Ancient of Days and was presented before him. And **to him was given dominion and glory and a kingdom**, that **all peoples, nations, and languages should serve him**; **his dominion is an everlasting dominion**, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom one that shall not be destroyed. — Daniel 7:13-14 (ESV)

#### Fulfillment

After his resurrection, Jesus declared:

> And Jesus came and said to them, **"All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me**. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations..." — Matthew 28:18-19 (ESV)

#### Jewish Perspective

**Debated Whether Individual or Collective.** Daniel 7:13-14 presents interpretive challenges: (1) **"Son of man" represents Israel**: Many Jewish scholars interpret "one like a son of man" (bar enash in Aramaic) as symbolizing the people of Israel collectively, not an individual Messiah. Daniel 7's context supports this—the chapter describes four beasts representing four kingdoms (Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, Rome), then "one like a son of man" (human figure) contrasting with the beastly kingdoms. This represents Israel/the saints receiving God's kingdom (see Daniel 7:18, 22, 27: "the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom"); (2) **Future event, not yet fulfilled**: Even Jews who interpret this as the Messiah argue it describes a future event—the Messiah coming "with the clouds of heaven" in visible, glorious manifestation to establish God's kingdom on earth. Jesus didn't fulfill this during his earthly ministry. Christians' claim of a "second coming" is seen as splitting one event into two to account for unfulfilled expectations; (3) **Comes to the Ancient of Days, not to earth**: The text says the son of man comes "to the Ancient of Days" (God), not to earth. This depicts a heavenly scene—the representative of God's people approaching God's throne. It's not describing the Messiah's arrival on earth; (4) **Universal visible kingdom required**: Daniel 7:14 promises that "all peoples, nations, and languages should serve him"—this requires visible, universal acknowledgment. The world does not universally serve Jesus as king; most people today are not Christians; (5) **Everlasting dominion not established**: The prophecy describes a kingdom that "shall not be destroyed." Yet Jesus was crucified, Christianity has been persecuted throughout history, and there's no visible earthly kingdom ruled by Jesus. Jews argue this proves Jesus didn't fulfill Daniel 7; (6) **"Son of man" as humble title**: Jesus' use of "Son of Man" as a self-designation could simply mean "human being" (the term's basic meaning), emphasizing his humanity and messianic hiddenness, not claiming to be Daniel's apocalyptic figure.

## Timeline: When the Messiah Would Come

### Daniel's Seventy Weeks

#### Prophecy

The prophet Daniel received a vision specifying *when* the Messiah would appear:

> Seventy weeks are decreed about your people and your holy city, to finish the transgression, to put an end to sin, and to atone for iniquity, to bring in everlasting righteousness... Know therefore and understand that from the going out of the word to restore and build Jerusalem to **the coming of an anointed one, a prince**, there shall be seven weeks. Then for sixty-two weeks it shall be built again with squares and moat, but in a troubled time. And **after the sixty-two weeks, an anointed one shall be cut off and shall have nothing**. — Daniel 9:24-26 (ESV)

The Messiah ("anointed one") would:
- Appear at a specific time (after 69 "weeks" from decree to rebuild Jerusalem)
- Be "cut off" (executed)
- Bring atonement for sin and everlasting righteousness

#### Fulfillment

Multiple interpretive frameworks exist for calculating the timeline (Jewish, Maccabean, Preterist, Futurist views differ on starting points and calculations). However, the core prediction stands: the Messiah would come, be cut off, and accomplish atonement during a specific historical window.

Jesus appeared during the first century AD:
- Began ministry ~26-30 AD
- Crucified ~30-33 AD (was "cut off")
- Accomplished atonement through his death
- Jerusalem destroyed by Rome in 70 AD (fulfilling "destroy the city and the sanctuary")

The timing aligns with Daniel's prophecy that the Messiah would be "cut off" before Jerusalem's destruction.

#### Jewish Perspective

**Highly Debated; Multiple Interpretations.** Daniel 9:24-27 is one of the most contested prophecies, with Jewish scholars offering several alternative interpretations:

**(1) Already fulfilled in Second Temple period**: Many Jews argue this prophecy was fulfilled during the Second Temple era, not pointing to Jesus:
- **"Anointed one" = Cyrus or Joshua the High Priest**: The first anointed one (9:25) refers to Cyrus the Persian king who decreed the temple's rebuilding (Isaiah 45:1 calls Cyrus "anointed"), or to Joshua the high priest who led temple restoration (Zechariah 3-4).
- **"Anointed one cut off" = Onias III**: The second anointed one who is "cut off" (9:26) refers to Onias III, the righteous high priest murdered ~170 BC during the Maccabean period (described in 2 Maccabees 4:34). His death preceded the temple's desecration by Antiochus IV Epiphanes.
- **Destruction by Antiochus**: The "prince who is to come" who destroys the city and sanctuary (9:26) is Antiochus IV Epiphanes, who desecrated the temple in 167 BC, not the Romans in 70 AD.

**(2) Timeline calculations disputed**:
- **Starting point unclear**: "The word to restore and build Jerusalem" (9:25) could refer to: (a) Cyrus' decree (538 BC), (b) Artaxerxes' decree to Ezra (458 BC), (c) Artaxerxes' decree to Nehemiah (445 BC). Different starting points yield different end dates.
- **"Weeks" are not years**: Some Jewish interpreters argue "weeks" (shabuim) means literal weeks (7-day periods), not "weeks of years" (490 years). This would place fulfillment much sooner, in the Persian period.
- **Math doesn't work**: Even using "weeks of years" (490 years), calculations from any reasonable decree date don't land precisely on Jesus' ministry or crucifixion. Christians use various methods (prophetic years, gaps, recalculations) that Jews see as manipulating the numbers.

**(3) Messiah not "cut off" in a good sense**:
- The Hebrew "yikaret" (cut off) typically means "executed as punishment" or "destroyed"—it's a negative term (Genesis 17:14; Exodus 12:15; Leviticus 17:10). Jews argue this doesn't describe the Messiah's redemptive death but rather someone being killed as a punishment or tragedy.
- The phrase "shall have nothing" (9:26) suggests the anointed one dies without achieving his purposes—hardly fitting for a successful messianic mission.

**(4) Atonement already accomplished**:
- Daniel 9:24 lists six goals: "finish transgression, put an end to sin, atone for iniquity, bring everlasting righteousness, seal vision and prophet, anoint most holy place."
- Jews argue these weren't accomplished by Jesus: sin continues, prophecy didn't end (though it did cease around 400 BC for Jews), the Most Holy Place wasn't anointed (the temple was destroyed instead), and everlasting righteousness wasn't established globally.

**(5) Contextual interpretation**:
- Daniel is in Babylonian exile (Daniel 9:2) pondering Jeremiah's prophecy of 70 years of exile. God's answer (70 "weeks") extends the timeframe but relates to the same issue—Israel's exile, restoration, and Second Temple period.
- The entire prophecy concerns events leading up to and through the Second Temple period, culminating in the Maccabean crisis and restoration. It's not about events 500+ years in Daniel's future.

**(6) Messianic interpretation is minority**:
- Traditional rabbinic sources (Talmud, medieval commentaries) rarely interpret Daniel 9:24-27 as messianic. The focus is on understanding the historical fulfillment in the Persian/Greek periods.
- Messianic interpretations became more prominent in Jewish-Christian debates but are not the dominant Jewish reading.

**Conclusion**: Jews argue that Daniel 9's 70 weeks prophecy, when understood in its Second Temple historical context, does not predict the Messiah's arrival in the first century AD, nor Jesus specifically. The various calculations, identifications, and applications Christians make require assumptions and interpretive methods Jews find unconvincing.
