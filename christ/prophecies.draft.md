# Fulfilled Prophecies about Jesus

- To Christians, he is the Christ, [the Son of God](https://son.ofgod.info), the savior of the world
- To Muslims, he is a revered prophet, born of a virgin, but not God's Son
- To Jews, he was a teacher who didn't fulfill messianic prophecies
- To secularists, he was perhaps a wise moral teacher, but nothing more

According to the Bible, God made several promises about the Christ.

If Jesus is the Christ, it changes everything. How we understand God, ourselves, history, and our eternal destiny.

Luke, who gathered many witness accounts, recorded:

> Beginning with **Moses and all the Prophets**, he *(Jesus)* interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself. — Luke 24:27 (ESV)

Jesus claimed that the Old Testament Scriptures testified about him. The question is: *Do they?*

## Genealogy and Royal Lineage

### The Abrahamic Blessing

#### Prophecy

God promised Abraham that through his descendant, all nations would be blessed:

> And **in your offspring shall all the nations of the earth be blessed**, because you have obeyed my voice. — Genesis 22:18 (ESV)

Not just Israel, but *all nations*—a universal blessing through one specific descendant.

#### Fulfillment

The apostle Peter explicitly applied this promise to Jesus:

> And when Peter saw it he addressed the people: "Men of Israel... you are the sons of the prophets and of **the covenant that God made with your fathers, saying to Abraham**,
>
>> 'And **in your offspring** shall all the families of the earth be blessed.' — Genesis 22:18
>
> God, having raised up His servant, sent him to you first, to bless you by turning every one of you from your wickedness."
>
> And as they were speaking to the people, the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came upon them, greatly annoyed because they were teaching the people and proclaiming in **Jesus** the resurrection from the dead.
>
> — Acts 3:12,25-4:2 (ESV)

Jesus is the promised offspring through whom all nations are blessed.

### The Scepter of Judah

#### Prophecy

Jacob, blessing his sons before death, prophesied about Judah's line:

> **The scepter shall not depart from Judah**, nor the ruler's staff from between his feet, until tribute comes to him; and **to him shall be the obedience of the peoples**. — Genesis 49:10 (ESV)

A ruler would come from Judah's tribe who would command the obedience of peoples.

#### Fulfillment

The Gospel of Matthew establishes Jesus' Judahite lineage:

> The book of the genealogy of **Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham**: Abraham was the father of Isaac, and Isaac the father of Jacob, and Jacob the father of **Judah** and his brothers... — Matthew 1:1-2 (ESV)

The lineage is explicitly documented: Abraham → **Judah** → David → Jesus.

### The Davidic Covenant: An Eternal Throne

#### Prophecy

God made a covenant with King David, promising an eternal kingdom through his descendant:

> When your days are fulfilled and you lie down with your fathers, **I will raise up your offspring after you**, who shall come from your body, and **I will establish his kingdom**. He shall build a house for my name, and **I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever**. I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son... And **your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before you. Your throne shall be established forever**. — 2 Samuel 7:12-16 (ESV)

Note the key promise: **forever**. Not a temporary dynasty but an *eternal* throne.

#### Fulfillment

Gabriel's annunciation to Mary directly applied this eternal throne to Jesus:

> He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. And **the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David**, and **he will reign over the house of Jacob forever**, and **of his kingdom there will be no end**. — Luke 1:32-33 (ESV)

Peter's Pentecost sermon confirmed this:

> Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that **God had sworn with an oath to him that he would set one of his descendants on his throne**, he foresaw and spoke about the resurrection of the Christ. — Acts 2:30 (ESV)

Jesus is the eternal king from David's line.

### Descended from Jesse

#### Prophecy

Isaiah specified the Messiah's lineage through Jesse (David's father):

> There shall come forth **a shoot from the stump of Jesse, and a branch from his roots** shall bear fruit. And **the Spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him**:
> * the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, 
> * the Spirit of counsel and might,
> * the Spirit of knowledge and the fear of the LORD. 
> And his delight shall be in the fear of the LORD.
>
> He shall not judge by what his eyes see, or decide disputes by what his ears hear, but with righteousness he shall judge the poor, and decide with equity for the meek of the earth; and he shall strike the earth with the rod of his mouth,
and with the breath of his lips he shall kill the wicked. Righteousness shall be the belt of his waist, and faithfulness the belt of his loins. 
>
> — Isaiah 11:1-5 (ESV)

The Messiah would be Spirit-empowered and from David's family line.

Regarding the judgement Isaiah prophecied, Jesus warned:

> For the Father judges no one, but has given **all judgment to [the Son](https://son.ofgod.info)**, that all may honor the Son, just as they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him.
>
> Truly, truly, I say to you, **whoever hears my word and believes Him who sent me has eternal life. He does not come into judgment**, but has passed from death to life.
>
> Truly, truly, I say to you, an hour is coming, and is now here, when the dead will hear the voice of [the Son of God](https://son.ofgod.info), and **those who hear will live**. For as the Father has life in himself, so **He has granted the Son** also to have life in himself. And **He has given him authority to execute judgment**, because he is [the Son of Man](https://son.ofgod.info/son-of-man). Do not marvel at this, for an hour is coming when all who are in the tombs will hear his voice and come out, those who have done good to **the resurrection of life**, and those who have done evil to **the resurrection of judgment**. 
>
> I can do nothing on my own. **As I hear, I judge, and my judgment is just**, because I seek not my own will but the will of Him who sent me.
>
> — John 5:22-30 (ESV)

#### Fulfillment

Matthew's genealogy traces Jesus through Jesse:

> The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham: Abraham was the father of Isaac, and Isaac the father of Jacob, and Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers... and Salmon the father of Boaz by Rahab, and Boaz the father of Obed by Ruth, and **Obed the father of Jesse**, and **Jesse the father of David** the king. — Matthew 1:1-6 (ESV)

The lineage is complete: Abraham → Judah → **Jesse** → David → Jesus.

## Birth Prophecies

### Born in Bethlehem

#### Prophecy

The prophet Micah, writing ~700 BC, specified the Messiah's birthplace:

> But you, **Bethlehem Ephrathah**, though you are little among the thousands of Judah, yet **out of you shall come forth to me the one to be ruler in Israel**, whose goings forth are from of old, from everlasting. — Micah 5:2 (NKJV)

Not Jerusalem (the capital), but tiny Bethlehem.

#### Fulfillment

Though Jesus' family lived in Nazareth, a Roman census required Joseph to register in his ancestral hometown:

> In those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be registered... And Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the town of Nazareth, to Judea, to **the city of David, which is called Bethlehem**, because he was of the house and lineage of David, to be registered with Mary, his betrothed, who was with child. And while they were there, the time came for her to give birth. And she gave birth to her firstborn son. — Luke 2:1-7 (ESV)

Jesus was born exactly where Micah predicted, 700 years earlier.

### Born of a Virgin

#### Prophecy

Isaiah prophesied an extraordinary birth:

> Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, **the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel**. — Isaiah 7:14 (ESV)

"Immanuel" means "God with us"—the child would represent God's presence.

#### Fulfillment

Mary conceived virginally through the Holy Spirit:

> When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together **she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit**. And her husband Joseph, being a just man and unwilling to put her to shame, resolved to divorce her quietly. But as he considered these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, "Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for **that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit**. She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins." All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet: **"Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel"** (which means, God with us). — Matthew 1:18-23 (ESV)

A miraculous, unique birth—exactly as Isaiah predicted.

### Titles of Divine Authority

#### Prophecy

Isaiah described the coming child with remarkable titles:

> For a child will be born to us, a son will be given to us, and **the government will be on his shoulders**. And he will be called **Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace**. Of the increase of his government and of peace **there will be no end**, on the throne of David and over his kingdom, to establish it and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness from this time forth and **forevermore**. — Isaiah 9:6-7 (ESV, edited)

A child who bears titles of deity and establishes an *eternal* government.

#### Fulfillment

After his resurrection, Jesus declared the fulfillment of this governmental authority:

> And Jesus came and said to them, **"All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me**. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations..." — Matthew 28:18-19 (ESV)

Jesus received the universal authority Isaiah foretold.

## Ministry and Teaching

### The Prophet Like Moses

#### Prophecy

Moses, the great lawgiver, predicted a future prophet who would surpass even his own authority:

> The LORD your God will raise up for you **a prophet like me from among you**, from your brothers—it is to him you shall listen... I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their brothers. And **I will put my words in his mouth**, and he shall speak to them all that I command him. And whoever will not listen to my words that he shall speak in my name, I myself will require it of him. — Deuteronomy 18:15, 18-19 (ESV)

This prophet would speak God's words with ultimate authority.

#### Fulfillment

After Jesus miraculously fed 5,000 people, the crowd recognized him as this prophet:

> When the people saw the sign that he had done, they said, **"This is indeed the Prophet who is to come into the world!"** — John 6:14 (ESV)

Peter explicitly identified Jesus as the prophet Moses foretold:

> For Moses truly said to the fathers, 'The LORD your God will raise up for you **a prophet like me** from your brethren. Him you shall hear in all things, whatever he says to you. And it shall be that every soul who will not hear that prophet shall be utterly destroyed from among the people.'... To you first, God, having **raised up his servant Jesus, sent him** to bless you, in turning away every one of you from your iniquities. — Acts 3:22-26 (NKJV)

### Anointed to Proclaim Good News

#### Prophecy

Isaiah described the Messiah's ministry mission:

> **The Spirit of the LORD God is upon me, because the LORD has anointed me to bring good news to the poor**; he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, **to proclaim liberty to the captives**, and the opening of the prison to those who are bound; to proclaim the year of the LORD's favor. — Isaiah 61:1-2 (ESV)

A ministry characterized by Spirit empowerment, good news to the poor, freedom for captives, and healing the brokenhearted.

#### Fulfillment

At the beginning of his ministry, Jesus read this passage in the Nazareth synagogue and declared its fulfillment:

> And the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was given to him. He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written, "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty those who are oppressed, to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor." And he rolled up the scroll and gave it back to the attendant and sat down. And the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him. And he began to say to them, **"Today this Scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing."** — Luke 4:17-21 (ESV)

Jesus explicitly claimed to fulfill Isaiah's prophecy—and demonstrated it through healing, teaching, and liberation ministry.

### Gentle and Humble

#### Prophecy

Isaiah depicted the Messiah's demeanor:

> Behold! My servant whom I uphold, my elect one in whom my soul delights! I have put my Spirit upon him; he will bring forth justice to the Gentiles. **He will not cry out, nor raise his voice, nor cause his voice to be heard in the street. A bruised reed he will not break, and smoking flax he will not quench**; he will bring forth justice for truth. — Isaiah 42:1-3 (NKJV)

Not loud or forceful, but gentle—not breaking the already bruised, not extinguishing the flickering flame.

#### Fulfillment

Matthew records Jesus' gentle approach:

> But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew from there. And great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all. Yet he warned them not to make him known, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying: "Behold! My servant whom I have chosen, my beloved in whom my soul is well pleased! I will put my Spirit upon him, and he will declare justice to the Gentiles. He will not quarrel nor cry out, nor will anyone hear his voice in the streets. **A bruised reed he will not break, and smoking flax he will not quench**, till he sends forth justice to victory; and in his name Gentiles will trust." — Matthew 12:15-21 (NKJV)

Jesus' ministry was characterized by compassion, not force—healing quietly, protecting the vulnerable.

### Teaching with Authority

#### Prophecy

Isaiah prophesied:

> All your children shall be **taught by the LORD**, and great shall be the peace of your children. — Isaiah 54:13 (ESV)

God himself would teach His people through the Messiah.

#### Fulfillment

Jesus applied this prophecy to himself:

> It is written in the Prophets, **"And they will all be taught by God."** Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me—not that anyone has seen the Father except he who is from God; he has seen the Father. — John 6:45-46 (ESV)

And after hearing Jesus teach, the crowds recognized this authority:

> And when Jesus finished these sayings, the crowds were astonished at his teaching, for **he was teaching them as one who had authority**, and not as their scribes. — Matthew 7:28-29 (ESV)

## Divine Sonship and Priestly Office

### Divine Sonship Declared

#### Prophecy

Psalm 2 presents God's decree concerning His anointed king:

> I will tell of the decree: The LORD said to me, **"You are my Son; today I have begotten you**. Ask of me, and I will make the nations your heritage, and the ends of the earth your possession... Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and you perish in the way, for his wrath is quickly kindled. Blessed are all who take refuge in him." — Psalm 2:7-8, 12 (ESV)

The Messiah would be called God's **Son**, receive the *nations* as inheritance, and deserve *worship* ("Kiss the Son").

#### Fulfillment

Paul's sermon explicitly connected this to Jesus' resurrection:

> So Paul stood up, and motioning with his hand said: ... We bring you the good news that what God promised to the fathers, this He has fulfilled to us their children by raising Jesus, as also it is written in the second Psalm, **"You are My Son, today I have begotten you."** — Acts 13:16, 32-33 (ESV)

The "begetting" referred to resurrection—divine validation of Jesus as God's Son.

### The Lord at God's Right Hand

#### Prophecy

Psalm 110 presents a startling image—David calling his own descendant "Lord":

> The LORD *(YHWH)* says to my Lord: **"Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool**." The LORD sends forth from Zion your mighty scepter. Rule in the midst of your enemies! Your people will offer themselves freely on the day of your power, in holy garments; from the womb of the morning, the dew of your youth will be yours. The LORD has sworn and will not change his mind, **"You are a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek."** — Psalm 110:1-4 (ESV)

This Messiah would:
- Sit at God's right hand (position of supreme authority)
- Rule over enemies
- Serve as *eternal priest* (combining king and priest roles)

The Melchizedek reference is significant—this priesthood predates and transcends the Levitical system.

#### Fulfillment

Jesus used this psalm to challenge the Pharisees' understanding:

> Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question, saying, "What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?" They said to him, "The son of David." He said to them, "How is it then that David, in the Spirit, calls him Lord, saying, **'The LORD (YHVH) said to my Lord, sit at My right hand, until I put your enemies under your feet'?** If then David calls him Lord, how is he his son?" And no one was able to answer him a word. — Matthew 22:41-46 (ESV)

After his resurrection, Jesus ascended to this position:

> So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, **was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God**. — Mark 16:19 (ESV)

Peter testified:

> Being therefore exalted at the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this that you yourselves are seeing and hearing. For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he himself says, **"The Lord said to my Lord, 'Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool.'"** — Acts 2:33-35 (ESV)

Regarding the eternal priesthood:

> So also Christ did not exalt himself to be made a high priest, but was appointed by him who said to him, "You are my Son, today I have begotten you"; as he says also in another place, **"You are a priest forever, after the order of Melchizedek."** — Hebrews 5:5-6 (ESV)

Jesus serves as both king (Davidic line) and eternal priest (Melchizedek order)—a unique combination.

## The Suffering Servant (Isaiah 52-53)

Isaiah 52-53 presents the most detailed prophecy of the Messiah's suffering. Written ~700 years before Jesus, it describes his mission with stunning precision. Let's examine each element with its fulfillment.

### Exalted Yet Disfigured

#### Prophecy

> Behold, **my servant shall act wisely; he shall be high and lifted up**, and shall be exalted. As many were astonished at you—**his appearance was so marred, beyond human semblance**, and his form beyond that of the children of mankind—so shall he sprinkle many nations. Kings shall shut their mouths because of him. — Isaiah 52:13-15 (ESV)

The Messiah would be both *exalted* and *disfigured*—glory through suffering.

#### Fulfillment

Jesus was exalted through resurrection and ascension, but only after brutal suffering during crucifixion—his appearance marred by scourging, beating, and crucifixion wounds.

### No External Beauty

#### Prophecy

> Who has believed what he has heard from us? And to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed? For he grew up before him like a young plant, and like a root out of dry ground; **he had no form or majesty that we should look at him, and no beauty that we should desire him**. — Isaiah 53:1-2 (ESV)

No external beauty or royal appearance—easily overlooked.

#### Fulfillment

Jesus grew up in humble circumstances, not in a palace. He was a carpenter's son from Nazareth, a town so insignificant it provoked the question: "Can anything good come out of Nazareth?" (John 1:46).

### Despised and Rejected

#### Prophecy

> **He was despised and rejected by men, a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief**; and as one from whom men hide their faces he was despised, and we esteemed him not. Surely **he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows**; yet we esteemed him stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted. — Isaiah 53:3-4 (ESV)

Social rejection and suffering on behalf of others.

#### Fulfillment

> He came to his own, and **his own people did not receive him**. — John 1:11 (ESV)

Even his brothers didn't believe:

> For not even his brothers believed in him. — John 7:5 (ESV)

The Jewish leaders sought to kill him:

> So the Jews sought all the more to kill him, because not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God. — John 5:18 (ESV)

### Pierced for Our Transgressions

#### Prophecy

> But **he was pierced for our transgressions; he was crushed for our iniquities**; upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace, and **with his wounds we are healed**. All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned—every one—to his own way; and **the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all**. — Isaiah 53:5-6 (ESV)

**Vicarious atonement**—he suffers *for* our sins, not his own. His wounds bring *our* healing.

#### Fulfillment

Jesus was literally pierced—nails through hands and feet, spear through side:

> Then he said to Thomas, "Put your finger here, and see **my hands**; and put out your hand, and place it in **my side**. Do not disbelieve, but believe." — John 20:27 (ESV)

> But one of the soldiers **pierced his side with a spear**, and at once there came out blood and water. — John 19:34 (ESV)

Paul explained the vicarious nature:

> For our sake he [God] made him [Jesus] **to be sin who knew no sin**, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God. — 2 Corinthians 5:21 (ESV)

### Silent Before Accusers

#### Prophecy

> He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, **yet he opened not his mouth**; **like a lamb that is led to the slaughter**, and like a sheep that before its shearers is silent, so he opened not his mouth. By oppression and judgment he was taken away; and as for his generation, who considered that he was cut off out of the land of the living, **stricken for the transgression of my people**? — Isaiah 53:7-8 (ESV)

Silent before accusers, led to slaughter, executed unjustly.

#### Fulfillment

> Now Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus said, "You have said so." But when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, **he gave no answer**. Then Pilate said to him, "Do you not hear how many things they testify against you?" But **he gave him no answer, not even to a single charge**, so that the governor was greatly amazed. — Matthew 27:11-14 (ESV)

Before Herod:

> So he questioned him at some length, but **he made no answer**. — Luke 23:9 (ESV)

### Buried with Wicked, Yet in Rich Man's Tomb

#### Prophecy

> And they made **his grave with the wicked and with a rich man in his death**, although **he had done no violence, and there was no deceit in his mouth**. Yet it was the will of the LORD to crush him; he has put him to grief; **when his soul makes an offering for guilt**, he shall see his offspring; he shall prolong his days; the will of the LORD shall prosper in his hand. — Isaiah 53:9-10 (ESV)

Buried with the wicked yet in a *rich man's tomb*. Sinless yet treated as a *guilt offering*. And remarkably—*he shall prolong his days* (life after death).

#### Fulfillment

**Buried with wicked:**
Jesus was crucified between two criminals:

> And with him they crucified **two robbers, one on his right and one on his left**. — Mark 15:27 (ESV)

**Yet in rich man's tomb:**

> When it was evening, there came **a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph**, who also was a disciple of Jesus. He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him. And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen shroud and **laid it in his own new tomb**, which he had cut in the rock. And he rolled a great stone to the entrance of the tomb and went away. — Matthew 27:57-60 (ESV)

**Sinless:**

> He committed no sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth. — 1 Peter 2:22 (ESV)

Even his enemies couldn't identify any sin:

> Which one of you convicts me of sin? — John 8:46 (ESV)

Pilate declared:

> I find no guilt in this man. — Luke 23:4 (ESV)

### Makes Many Righteous, Numbered with Transgressors

#### Prophecy

> Out of the anguish of his soul he shall see and be satisfied; by his knowledge shall the righteous one, my servant, **make many to be accounted righteous**, and he shall bear their iniquities. Therefore I will divide him a portion with the many, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong, because he poured out his soul to death and **was numbered with the transgressors**; yet **he bore the sin of many, and makes intercession for the transgressors**. — Isaiah 53:11-12 (ESV)

The Servant *makes many righteous* through bearing their sins. Counted among criminals yet interceding for sinners.

#### Fulfillment

Jesus himself cited this prophecy:

> For I tell you that this Scripture must be fulfilled in me: **"And he was numbered with the transgressors."** For what is written about me has its fulfillment. — Luke 22:37 (ESV)

And it happened—crucified between criminals:

> And with him they crucified **two robbers, one on his right and one on his left**. — Mark 15:27 (ESV)

## Crucifixion Foretold (Psalm 22)

Written by David ~1000 years before crucifixion was invented, Psalm 22 describes execution by crucifixion with eerie precision. Let's examine each element.

### Cry of Forsakenness

#### Prophecy

> **My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?** — Psalm 22:1 (ESV)

#### Fulfillment

> And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, "Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?" that is, **"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"** — Matthew 27:46 (ESV)

Jesus quoted Psalm 22's opening words on the cross—experiencing the spiritual anguish David prophetically described.

### Mocking Words

#### Prophecy

> All who see me mock me; they make mouths at me; they wag their heads; **"He trusts in the LORD; let him deliver him; let him rescue him, for he delights in him!"** — Psalm 22:7-8 (ESV)

#### Fulfillment

> And those who passed by derided him, wagging their heads and saying, "You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross." So also the chief priests, with the scribes and elders, mocked him, saying, "He saved others; he cannot save himself. He is the King of Israel; let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him. **He trusts in God; let God deliver him now, if he desires him**. For he said, 'I am the Son of God.'" — Matthew 27:39-43 (ESV)

The mockers unknowingly quoted Psalm 22 verbatim.

### Pierced Hands and Feet

#### Prophecy

> For dogs encompass me; a company of evildoers encircles me; **they have pierced my hands and feet**—I can count all my bones—they stare and gloat over me. — Psalm 22:16-17 (ESV)

"Pierced my hands and feet" describes crucifixion—a Roman execution method not invented when David wrote this (~1000 BC).

#### Fulfillment

Crucifixion involved nails through hands and feet. After resurrection, Jesus showed the wounds:

> Then he said to Thomas, "Put your finger here, and see **my hands**; and put out your hand, and place it in my side. Do not disbelieve, but believe." — John 20:27 (ESV)

Thomas could see and touch the nail wounds in Jesus' hands.

### Garments Divided by Casting Lots

#### Prophecy

> **They divide my garments among them, and for my clothing they cast lots**. — Psalm 22:18 (ESV)

#### Fulfillment

> And when they had crucified him, **they divided his garments among them by casting lots**. — Matthew 27:35 (ESV)

John provides more detail:

> When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his garments and divided them into four parts, one part for each soldier; also his tunic. But the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom, so they said to one another, "Let us not tear it, but **cast lots for it to see whose it shall be**." This was to fulfill the Scripture which says, "They divided my garments among them, and for my clothing they cast lots." — John 19:23-24 (ESV)

## Specific Events of Passion Week

### Triumphal Entry on a Donkey

#### Prophecy

Zechariah foresaw the Messiah's entry into Jerusalem:

> Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! Shout aloud, O daughter of Jerusalem! Behold, **your king is coming to you; righteous and having salvation is he, humble and mounted on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey**. — Zechariah 9:9 (ESV)

A king entering Jerusalem—not on a warhorse, but humbly on a donkey.

#### Fulfillment

> The next day the large crowd that had come to the feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem. So they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him, crying out, "Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel!" And Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it, just as it is written, **"Fear not, daughter of Zion; behold, your king is coming, sitting on a donkey's colt!"** — John 12:12-16 (ESV)

### Betrayed for Thirty Pieces of Silver

#### Prophecy

Zechariah recorded a symbolic act involving a specific price:

> Then I said to them, "If it seems good to you, give me my wages; but if not, keep them." And they weighed out as my wages **thirty pieces of silver**. — Zechariah 11:12 (ESV)

Thirty silver pieces (the price of a slave)—a contemptuous valuation.

#### Fulfillment

> Then one of the twelve, whose name was Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests and said, "What will you give me if I deliver him over to you?" And **they paid him thirty pieces of silver**. — Matthew 26:14-15 (ESV)

The exact amount Zechariah predicted.

### Money Thrown in Temple, Used for Potter's Field

#### Prophecy

> Then the LORD said to me, "**Throw it to the potter**"—the lordly price at which I was priced by them. So I took the thirty pieces of silver and **threw them into the house of the LORD, to the potter**. — Zechariah 11:13 (ESV)

#### Fulfillment

> Then when Judas, his betrayer, saw that Jesus was condemned, he changed his mind and **brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests** and the elders, saying, "I have sinned by betraying innocent blood." They said, "What is that to us? See to it yourself." And **throwing down the pieces of silver into the temple**, he departed, and he went and hanged himself. But the chief priests, taking the pieces of silver, said, "It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is blood money." So they took counsel and **bought with them the potter's field** as a burial place for strangers. — Matthew 27:3-7 (ESV)

Thirty silver pieces, thrown into the temple, used to buy a potter's field—precisely as Zechariah wrote.

### Disciples Scattered

#### Prophecy

Zechariah prophesied:

> "Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, against the man who stands next to me," declares the LORD of hosts. **"Strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered**; I will turn my hand against the little ones." — Zechariah 13:7 (ESV)

When the shepherd is struck, his followers scatter.

#### Fulfillment

Jesus quoted this prophecy before his arrest:

> And Jesus said to them, "You will all fall away, for it is written, **'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.'"** — Mark 14:27 (ESV)

And it happened:

> Then all the disciples **left him and fled**. — Matthew 26:56 (ESV)

### Pierced Side

#### Prophecy

Zechariah saw a future mourning over one who was pierced:

> And I will pour out on the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem a spirit of compassion and supplication, so that, **when they look on him whom they have pierced, they shall mourn for him**, as one mourns for an only child, and weep bitterly over him, as one weeps over a firstborn. — Zechariah 12:10 (ESV)

#### Fulfillment

> But one of the soldiers **pierced his side with a spear**, and at once there came out blood and water. He who saw it has borne witness—his testimony is true, and he knows that he is telling the truth—that you also may believe. For these things took place that the Scripture might be fulfilled: "Not one of his bones will be broken." And again another Scripture says, **"They will look on him whom they have pierced."** — John 19:34-37 (ESV)

## Resurrection and Exaltation

### Not Abandoned to the Grave

#### Prophecy

David wrote prophetically:

> For you will not abandon my soul to Sheol, **or let your holy one see corruption**. You make known to me the path of life; in your presence there is fullness of joy; at your right hand are pleasures forevermore. — Psalm 16:10-11 (ESV)

The Holy One would not experience bodily decay—implying resurrection before decomposition.

#### Fulfillment

The apostle Peter preached at Pentecost:

> Brothers, I may say to you with confidence about the patriarch David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day. Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would set one of his descendants on his throne, **he foresaw and spoke about the resurrection of the Christ**, that he was not abandoned to Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption. **This Jesus God raised up, and of that we all are witnesses**. — Acts 2:29-32 (ESV)

Jesus rose from the dead before his body could decay—fulfilling David's prophecy.

### Resurrection on the Third Day

#### Prophecy

While Hosea 6:2 in context refers to Israel ("After two days he will revive us; on the third day he will raise us up"), Jesus applied the "third day" pattern to himself:

> And he began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed, and **after three days rise again**. — Mark 8:31 (ESV)

#### Fulfillment

> Now after the Sabbath, toward the dawn of the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb... But the angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified. **He is not here, for he has risen**, as he said." — Matthew 28:1, 5-6 (ESV)

Jesus rose on the third day:
- Crucified: Friday (Day 1)
- In tomb: Saturday (Day 2)
- Risen: Sunday (Day 3)

### Ascended to God's Right Hand

#### Prophecy

As noted earlier, Psalm 110:1 prophesied:

> The LORD says to my Lord: **"Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool."**

#### Fulfillment

> So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, **was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God**. — Mark 16:19 (ESV)

Peter testified:

> Being therefore exalted at the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this that you yourselves are seeing and hearing. For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he himself says, **"The Lord said to my Lord, 'Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool.'"** — Acts 2:33-35 (ESV)

### Given All Authority

#### Prophecy

Daniel's apocalyptic vision foretold universal dominion:

> I saw in the night visions, and behold, with the clouds of heaven there came **one like a son of man**, and he came to the Ancient of Days and was presented before him. And **to him was given dominion and glory and a kingdom**, that **all peoples, nations, and languages should serve him**; **his dominion is an everlasting dominion**, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom one that shall not be destroyed. — Daniel 7:13-14 (ESV)

#### Fulfillment

After his resurrection, Jesus declared:

> And Jesus came and said to them, **"All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me**. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations..." — Matthew 28:18-19 (ESV)

## Timeline: When the Messiah Would Come

### Daniel's Seventy Weeks

#### Prophecy

The prophet Daniel received a vision specifying *when* the Messiah would appear:

> Seventy weeks are decreed about your people and your holy city, to finish the transgression, to put an end to sin, and to atone for iniquity, to bring in everlasting righteousness... Know therefore and understand that from the going out of the word to restore and build Jerusalem to **the coming of an anointed one, a prince**, there shall be seven weeks. Then for sixty-two weeks it shall be built again with squares and moat, but in a troubled time. And **after the sixty-two weeks, an anointed one shall be cut off and shall have nothing**. — Daniel 9:24-26 (ESV)

The Messiah ("anointed one") would:
- Appear at a specific time (after 69 "weeks" from decree to rebuild Jerusalem)
- Be "cut off" (executed)
- Bring atonement for sin and everlasting righteousness

#### Fulfillment

Multiple interpretive frameworks exist for calculating the timeline (Jewish, Maccabean, Preterist, Futurist views differ on starting points and calculations). However, the core prediction stands: the Messiah would come, be cut off, and accomplish atonement during a specific historical window.

Jesus appeared during the first century AD:
- Began ministry ~26-30 AD
- Crucified ~30-33 AD (was "cut off")
- Accomplished atonement through his death
- Jerusalem destroyed by Rome in 70 AD (fulfilling "destroy the city and the sanctuary")

The timing aligns with Daniel's prophecy that the Messiah would be "cut off" before Jerusalem's destruction.

## The Remarkable Precision

### Statistical Improbability

Mathematician Peter Stoner, in his book *Science Speaks*, calculated the probability of one person fulfilling just 8 of these prophecies by chance:

- Born in Bethlehem (Micah 5:2)
- Preceded by a messenger (Malachi 3:1)
- Entered Jerusalem on a donkey (Zechariah 9:9)
- Betrayed by a friend (Psalm 41:9)
- Sold for thirty silver pieces (Zechariah 11:12)
- Silent before accusers (Isaiah 53:7)
- Hands and feet pierced (Psalm 22:16)
- Crucified with thieves (Isaiah 53:12)

**The probability? 1 in 10^17** (1 in 100,000,000,000,000,000).

**To illustrate:** Cover the entire state of Texas with silver dollars two feet deep. Mark one coin. Blindfold a person and tell them to walk anywhere in Texas and pick up one coin. The chance they pick the marked coin equals the probability of fulfilling just these 8 prophecies by accident.

**Jesus fulfilled not 8, but 300+ prophecies.**

### Prophecies Beyond Human Control

Many prophecies Jesus couldn't have manipulated:

#### Couldn't Control:
- Place of birth (Bethlehem)
- Virgin birth
- Genealogy (descended from Abraham, Judah, David)
- Manner of death (crucifixion, a Roman method)
- Soldiers casting lots for garments
- Side pierced after death
- Betrayal price (thirty silver pieces)
- Burial in rich man's tomb
- Not being rejected by his people (they chose to reject him)

#### Could Appear to Control:
- Entering Jerusalem on a donkey
- Claiming to fulfill prophecy

But this doesn't explain the hundreds of details he couldn't control.

### Written Centuries Before

The Old Testament was completed ~400 BC (Malachi). The **Dead Sea Scrolls** (discovered 1947) contain complete copies of Isaiah and other prophetic books dating to ~200 BC—**before Jesus was born**.

No one can claim the prophecies were written after the fact. They're documented in manuscripts predating Jesus by centuries.
