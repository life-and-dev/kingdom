# Contemporary Evidence: Modern Testimony and Historical Confirmation

## Introduction: Faith Grounded in Facts

Christianity makes historical claims that can be investigated:
- Jesus existed
- He performed miracles
- He was crucified under Pontius Pilate
- He rose from the dead
- His followers were willing to die for their testimony

These aren't matters of "blind faith"—they're historical assertions subject to evidence and investigation.

This article presents contemporary evidence for Jesus through multiple streams:

1. **Lee Strobel's Investigation**: How an atheist journalist's research led to conversion
2. **Archaeological Discoveries**: Physical evidence confirming Gospel accounts
3. **Non-Christian Historical Sources**: Enemy testimony and secular confirmation
4. **Modern Testimonies**: Lives transformed today

The evidence keeps mounting. History supports the Gospels. Lives continue transforming.

# Part 1: Lee Strobel's Investigation

## The Skeptic's Journey

### Background

**Who He Was:**
- **Award-winning journalist**: Legal editor for the *Chicago Tribune*
- **Yale Law School graduate**: Trained in legal evidence and cross-examination
- **Committed atheist**: Viewed Christianity as myth and superstition
- **Husband to a new believer**: His wife Leslie converted to Christianity in 1979

### The Motivation

When Leslie became a Christian, Lee was alarmed. He feared religion would ruin their marriage. But instead of divorce, he noticed positive changes:
- More loving
- More patient
- Better mother

This sparked a question: *What if it's actually true?*

As a journalist trained in investigative reporting, Lee decided to apply his skills to examine Christianity's core claims. His goal: **disprove Christianity and rescue his wife from delusion**.

### The Investigation (1980-1982)

Over nearly two years, Lee interviewed leading scholars in multiple fields, asking hard questions and demanding evidence. He approached it like a legal case: What evidence exists? Is it credible? Would it hold up in court?

His research became the book ***The Case for Christ*** (published 1998), which documents his findings.

---

## The Evidence Examined

Strobel organized his investigation around five categories of evidence:

### 1. Eyewitness Evidence

**The Question:**
Were the Gospels written by eyewitnesses who directly observed Jesus' life, or by later authors who embellished legends?

**The Research:**

Lee interviewed Dr. Craig Blomberg (renowned New Testament scholar) and others, examining:

**Dating of the Gospels:**
- Mark: 60s AD (within 30 years of Jesus' death)
- Matthew and Luke: 60s-70s AD
- John: 80s-90s AD

All written within the lifetime of eyewitnesses who could correct errors.

**Eyewitness Authors:**
- **Matthew**: Tax collector, one of the Twelve Apostles
- **Mark**: Companion of Peter, recording Peter's eyewitness testimony
- **Luke**: Physician who interviewed eyewitnesses (Luke 1:1-4)
- **John**: "Beloved disciple," one of the Twelve

**Early Creedal Statements:**

Paul quotes an early creed in 1 Corinthians 15:3-7, dating to within **2-5 years** of Jesus' crucifixion:

> For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve. Then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have fallen asleep. Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles.

**Conclusion:**
The Gospels are based on eyewitness testimony, not late myths. The resurrection was proclaimed from the very beginning.

---

### 2. Documentary Evidence

**The Question:**
Can we trust that the Gospel texts we have today accurately reflect what was originally written? Haven't they been corrupted over centuries of copying?

**The Research:**

Lee examined manuscript evidence with Dr. Bruce Metzger (Princeton professor, world's foremost expert on New Testament manuscripts).

**The Numbers:**
- **5,800+ Greek New Testament manuscripts**
- **10,000+ Latin manuscripts**
- **9,300+ manuscripts in other languages**
- Total: **24,000+ manuscript copies**

By comparison:
- Homer's *Iliad*: 643 manuscripts (next best-attested ancient work)
- Julius Caesar's *Gallic Wars*: 10 manuscripts

**The Accuracy:**
- **99.5% textually pure** across all manuscripts
- The 0.5% variants are minor (spelling differences, word order)
- **No major doctrine affected** by textual variants

**Time Gap:**
- Earliest NT fragment: John Rylands Papyrus (125 AD)—within 30 years of original
- Complete manuscripts: Codex Sinaiticus, Codex Vaticanus (325-350 AD)

Compare to other ancient works:
- Plato: earliest copy 1,200 years after original
- Aristotle: 1,400 years
- Homer: 500 years

**Conclusion:**
The New Testament is the best-attested document from antiquity. We have what the authors wrote.

---

### 3. Corroborating Evidence

**The Question:**
Do sources outside the Bible confirm the Gospels' claims about Jesus?

**The Research:**

Lee found multiple non-Christian sources confirming key facts:

**Jewish Sources:**

*Josephus* (Jewish historian, 37-100 AD):
> At this time there was a wise man called Jesus, and his conduct was good, and he was known to be virtuous. Many people among the Jews and the other nations became his disciples. Pilate condemned him to be crucified and to die. But those who had become his disciples did not abandon his discipleship. They reported that he had appeared to them three days after his crucifixion and that he was alive.

*Babylonian Talmud* (Jewish rabbinical writings):
> On the eve of Passover they hanged Jesus of Nazareth... because he practiced sorcery and led Israel astray.

**Roman Sources:**

*Tacitus* (Roman historian, 56-120 AD):
> Christus, from whom the name [Christian] had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilate.

*Pliny the Younger* (Roman governor, 61-113 AD):
Writing to Emperor Trajan about Christians: They "were in the habit of meeting on a certain fixed day before it was light, when they sang in alternate verses a hymn to Christ, as to a god."

*Suetonius* (Roman historian, 69-122 AD):
Mentions "Chrestus" causing disturbances among Jews in Rome.

**What Enemies Confirm:**
Even hostile sources acknowledge:
- Jesus existed
- Performed extraordinary deeds (called "sorcery" by opponents)
- Crucified under Pontius Pilate
- Followers worshiped him as divine
- Movement spread despite persecution

**Conclusion:**
Multiple non-Christian sources corroborate the Gospel accounts within decades of Jesus' life.

---

### 4. Scientific Evidence

**The Question:**
Did Jesus truly die on the cross? Could he have merely fainted and revived in the tomb?

**The Research:**

Lee consulted medical experts who analyzed the crucifixion accounts.

**The "Swoon Theory" Debunked:**

Some skeptics proposed Jesus didn't actually die but swooned, then revived in the cool tomb.

Dr. Alexander Metherell (physician with engineering and medical degrees) explained why this is medically impossible:

**Scourging:**
Roman flogging used a whip with metal balls and bone fragments, tearing flesh from back, legs, and buttocks. Many victims died from this alone.

**Crucifixion:**
- Nails through wrists (not palms) and feet
- Weight causes suffocation unless victim pushes up on nail-pierced feet
- Eventually, exhaustion prevents breathing

**Spear Wound:**
> But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and at once there came out blood and water. — John 19:34

Medical analysis: "Blood and water" indicates pericardial effusion (fluid around heart) and pleural effusion (fluid around lungs)—signs of heart failure and death.

**Conclusion:**
Jesus definitely died. No one survives Roman crucifixion, let alone unwrapping burial cloths, rolling away a massive stone, overpowering guards, and walking miles on nail-pierced feet.

---

### 5. Psychological Evidence

**The Question:**
Could the resurrection appearances have been hallucinations? Mass delusion?

**The Research:**

Lee examined psychological evidence with Dr. Gary Collins (clinical psychologist).

**Why Hallucinations Don't Explain It:**

**1. Group Hallucinations Don't Exist:**
Hallucinations are individual brain events. Two people can't share the same hallucination simultaneously.

Yet Jesus appeared to:
- Two disciples on the road to Emmaus (Luke 24)
- Ten disciples in a room (John 20:19-24)
- Eleven disciples, including Thomas (John 20:26-29)
- **500+ people at once** (1 Corinthians 15:6)

**2. Wrong Psychological Profile:**
Hallucinations require expectation, anticipation, heightened emotional state.

The disciples expected nothing. They were:
- Hiding in fear (John 20:19)
- In despair (Luke 24:17-21)
- Returning to fishing (John 21:3)
- Skeptical when told about resurrection (Luke 24:11)

Thomas refused to believe without physical evidence (John 20:25).

**3. Physical Interactions:**
Hallucinations can't be touched, don't eat food, don't cook breakfast.

Jesus:
- Invited touch (John 20:27)
- Ate fish (Luke 24:42-43)
- Cooked breakfast (John 21:9-13)
- Appeared indoors and outdoors, to individuals and groups, over 40 days

**4. Stopped Suddenly:**
Hallucinations don't stop uniformly across multiple people. Yet the appearances stopped after 40 days at the ascension—and never resumed.

**5. Transformed Skeptics:**
- **James** (Jesus' brother): was skeptical (John 7:5), saw the risen Jesus (1 Corinthians 15:7), became leader of Jerusalem church, martyred for faith
- **Paul** (Saul): persecuted Christians, encountered risen Jesus (Acts 9), became greatest missionary, martyred for faith

Hallucinations don't convert hostile opponents.

**Conclusion:**
The resurrection appearances can't be explained psychologically. The disciples saw the physically risen Jesus.

---

## Strobel's Conclusion

After nearly two years of intensive investigation, examining evidence like a legal case, Lee Strobel reached a verdict:

> **I had seen enough. It was not a decision I made lightly. It was based on a thorough investigation of the facts. The evidence was absolutely convincing.**

In November 1981, Lee Strobel became a Christian.

**He later wrote:**

> In light of the overwhelming historical evidence, the only rational conclusion was that Jesus Christ was who he claimed to be: the Son of God who confirmed his divinity by returning from the dead. Not only that, but I had learned that he had made atonement for my sins on the cross. My investigation of the evidence had led me to the verdict that would change my eternal destiny: faith in Jesus Christ.

An atheist set out to disprove Christianity. The evidence convinced him it was true.

# Part 2: Archaeological Discoveries

## Physical Evidence Confirming Gospel Accounts

Archaeology continues uncovering physical evidence supporting the New Testament's historical reliability.

### Pool of Bethesda

**Gospel Account:**

> Now there is in Jerusalem by the Sheep Gate a pool, in Aramaic called Bethesda, which has five roofed colonnades. — John 5:2 (ESV)

For centuries, critics dismissed this as fiction—no such pool with "five colonnades" was known.

**Discovery:**

Excavations in Jerusalem (1956-1966, 2004-2009) uncovered the Pool of Bethesda exactly as John described—with five colonnades (four sides + dividing middle).

**Significance:**
John wrote accurate historical details about first-century Jerusalem, confirming he was an eyewitness.

---

### Pool of Siloam

**Gospel Account:**

> He said to him, "Go, wash in the pool of Siloam"... So he went and washed and came back seeing. — John 9:7 (ESV)

**Discovery:**

In 2004, construction workers accidentally uncovered the actual Pool of Siloam from Jesus' time—stone steps descending into a large pool, matching John's description.

**Significance:**
Another precise historical detail verified by archaeology.

---

### Pontius Pilate Inscription

**Gospel Account:**

All four Gospels name Pontius Pilate as the Roman governor who sentenced Jesus to crucifixion.

**Discovery:**

In 1961, Italian archaeologists discovered a limestone inscription at Caesarea Maritima reading:

> **[PON]TIUS PILATUS**
> **[PRAEF]ECTUS IUDA[EA]E**

("Pontius Pilate, Prefect of Judea")

**Significance:**
Physical proof that Pontius Pilate was the Roman prefect of Judea during the time the Gospels claim—confirming the New Testament's historical accuracy.

---

### Caiaphas Ossuary

**Gospel Account:**

> Then the high priest tore his robes and said, "He has uttered blasphemy... What is your judgment?" They answered, "He deserves death." — Matthew 26:65-66 (ESV)

Caiaphas was the high priest who condemned Jesus.

**Discovery:**

In 1990, construction workers south of Jerusalem accidentally uncovered a burial cave containing ossuaries (bone boxes). One was ornately decorated and inscribed:

> **Yehosef bar Qayafa**
> ("Joseph, son of Caiaphas")

This is the burial box of Caiaphas, the high priest who presided over Jesus' trial.

**Significance:**
Physical evidence of a key Gospel figure's existence.

---

### Crucifixion Victim with Nail Through Heel

**Gospel Account:**

> And when they had crucified him... — Matthew 27:35

For years, skeptics questioned whether crucifixion involved nails (some ancient sources mention ropes).

**Discovery:**

In 1968, archaeologists discovered an ossuary in Jerusalem containing the bones of a crucifixion victim named Yehohanan. A 7-inch iron nail was still lodged through his heel bone.

**Significance:**
Physical proof that:
1. Romans used nails in crucifixion (as Gospels describe)
2. Nails went through feet/ankles (Psalm 22:16; John 20:25)
3. Crucifixion was practiced in first-century Judea exactly when the Gospels say

---

## The Pattern

Archaeology repeatedly confirms Gospel details critics once dismissed:
- Locations (pools, cities, regions)
- People (Pilate, Caiaphas, rulers)
- Practices (crucifixion methods, burial customs)
- Cultural details (architecture, social structures)

**No archaeological discovery has ever contradicted the New Testament.**

---

# Part 3: Non-Christian Historical Sources

## Enemy Testimony Strengthens the Case

### Why Enemy Testimony Matters

In legal proceedings, **enemy testimony** (witnesses hostile to the defendant) carries special weight. If even enemies confirm facts, those facts are highly credible.

Multiple non-Christian sources—Jewish and Roman, hostile to Christianity—confirm key Gospel claims.

---

### Josephus (Jewish Historian, 37-100 AD)

**Who He Was:**
Flavius Josephus, Jewish historian who wrote *Antiquities of the Jews* (~93-94 AD) for Roman audiences.

**What He Wrote:**

**Testimonium Flavianum** (Book 18, Chapter 3):

> At this time there was a wise man called Jesus, and his conduct was good, and he was known to be virtuous. Many people among the Jews and the other nations became his disciples. Pilate condemned him to be crucified and to die. But those who had become his disciples did not abandon his discipleship. They reported that he had appeared to them three days after his crucifixion and that he was alive.

(Scholarly consensus accepts the core text as authentic, though later Christians may have added embellishments.)

**Reference to James** (Book 20, Chapter 9):

> [Ananus] convened a meeting of the Sanhedrin and brought before them a man named James, **the brother of Jesus who was called the Christ**, and certain others. He accused them of having transgressed the law and delivered them up to be stoned.

**What This Confirms:**
- Jesus existed
- Known as a wise, virtuous teacher
- Had many disciples
- Crucified under Pilate
- Followers claimed he rose from the dead
- Had a brother named James

---

### Tacitus (Roman Historian, 56-120 AD)

**Who He Was:**
Cornelius Tacitus, senator and historian, considered Rome's greatest historian. Hostile to Christianity.

**What He Wrote:**

In *Annals* (Book 15, Chapter 44), describing Nero's persecution of Christians after the Great Fire of Rome (64 AD):

> Nero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for their abominations, called Christians by the populace. **Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators, Pontius Pilate**, and a most mischievous superstition, thus checked for the moment, again broke out not only in Judea, the first source of the evil, but even in Rome.

**What This Confirms:**
- Jesus (Christus) existed
- Executed by Pontius Pilate
- During reign of Tiberius (14-37 AD)—matches Gospel timeline
- Movement spread from Judea to Rome
- Christians faced persecution

**Significance:**
Tacitus was writing for Roman aristocracy, accessing imperial records. He confirmed the crucifixion as historical fact.

---

### Pliny the Younger (Roman Governor, 61-113 AD)

**Who He Was:**
Pliny, governor of Bithynia (modern Turkey), wrote to Emperor Trajan (~112 AD) asking how to deal with Christians.

**What He Wrote:**

In *Letters*, Book 10, Letter 96:

> They [Christians] were in the habit of meeting on a certain fixed day before it was light, when they **sang in alternate verses a hymn to Christ, as to a god**, and bound themselves by a solemn oath, not to do any wicked deeds... After this it was their custom to separate, and then reassemble to partake of food—but food of an ordinary and innocent kind.

**What This Confirms:**
- Christians worshiped Christ as divine
- Met for worship on a "fixed day" (Sunday)
- Early date of worship practices (within 80 years of Jesus)
- Ethical commitment

**Significance:**
Even Roman officials acknowledged Christians worshiped Jesus as God from the earliest times.

---

### Babylonian Talmud (Jewish Rabbinic Writings)

**What It Is:**
Collection of rabbinic discussions and teachings, compiled ~500 AD but containing earlier traditions.

**What It Writes:**

*Sanhedrin 43a*:

> On the eve of Passover they hanged Jesus of Nazareth. And the herald went out before him for forty days, saying: "He is going to be stoned, because he practiced sorcery and enticed and led Israel astray."

**What This Confirms:**
- Jesus existed
- Executed around Passover (matches Gospels)
- Performed extraordinary acts (called "sorcery" by opponents)
- "Led Israel astray" (had significant following)

**Significance:**
Jewish sources hostile to Christianity confirm Jesus' existence, miracles (reinterpreted negatively), and execution—inadvertently supporting Gospel claims.

---

## What Enemies Agree On

Even sources hostile to Christianity confirm:

✓ Jesus existed
✓ Performed extraordinary deeds (miracles or "sorcery")
✓ Had many followers
✓ Crucified under Pontius Pilate during Tiberius' reign
✓ Movement claimed he rose from the dead
✓ Followers worshiped him as divine
✓ Movement spread rapidly despite persecution

**These facts are historically established**, attested by both friendly and hostile witnesses.

---

# Part 4: Modern Testimonies

## Lives Transformed Today

Jesus isn't merely a historical figure studied in books. People today encounter him, and evidence continues mounting.

### Scholarly Conversions

**C.S. Lewis** (1898-1963):
Oxford professor, atheist, became one of Christianity's greatest apologists. Wrote *Mere Christianity*, *The Chronicles of Narnia*, and more.

**Francis Collins** (b. 1950):
Directed the Human Genome Project, leading scientist. Former atheist, encountered Jesus through examining historical evidence and moral law. Wrote *The Language of God*.

**Rosaria Butterfield** (b. 1962):
Leftist professor, lesbian activist, hostile to Christianity. Researched to write a critical book about the Religious Right, encountered Jesus through the Bible, converted. Wrote *The Secret Thoughts of an Unlikely Convert*.

**The Pattern:**
Skeptics investigating Christianity with open minds encounter evidence that changes lives.

---

### Muslim Visions and Dreams

A documented phenomenon: Muslims in closed countries report encountering Jesus in dreams and visions, leading to conversion despite persecution risk.

**Why This Matters:**
- No Christian missionaries present (restricted access countries)
- No cultural pressure (would face persecution)
- Consistent testimony (Jesus identifying himself, displaying love, calling them)

Organizations like *More Than Dreams* document thousands of such testimonies.

---

### Miraculous Healings

Documented cases of healing following prayer in Jesus' name:

- Dr. Candy Gunther Brown (Indiana University professor) published peer-reviewed studies showing statistically significant improvements in vision and hearing following prayer in Jesus' name
- Medical documentation of cancer remissions, healing of paralysis, and other conditions following prayer
- Healings occurring in contexts where placebo effect doesn't explain (blind from birth, verified medical conditions)

While not all prayers result in healing (God's sovereignty), documented cases exist.

---

### Near-Death Experiences

Thousands report near-death experiences (NDEs) involving:
- Encounters with a being of light identified as Jesus
- Overwhelming love and acceptance
- Life review in Jesus' presence
- Sent back with mission to tell others

Researchers like Dr. Jeffrey Long documented thousands of NDEs, finding consistent patterns across cultures.

**Notable Cases:**

**Don Piper**: Pronounced dead after car accident, spent 90 minutes in heaven, returned. Wrote *90 Minutes in Heaven*.

**Colton Burpo**: Four-year-old during emergency surgery, described heaven, Jesus, meeting deceased relatives he'd never known about. Verified details. Book: *Heaven is for Real*.

While NDEs aren't primary evidence for Christianity, they add to cumulative testimony.

---

# Conclusion: Evidence Keeps Growing

## Summary of Contemporary Evidence

**Lee Strobel's Investigation:**
Atheist journalist applied legal evidence standards, interviewed leading scholars, concluded Jesus is the Son of God who rose from the dead.

**Archaeological Discoveries:**
Physical evidence confirms Gospel accuracy—pools, inscriptions, burial boxes, crucifixion methods.

**Non-Christian Historical Sources:**
Josephus, Tacitus, Pliny, Talmud—even enemies confirm Jesus' existence, miracles, crucifixion, resurrection claims, worship as divine.

**Modern Testimonies:**
Scholarly conversions, Muslim visions, documented healings, near-death experiences—lives continue transforming.

---

## The Cumulative Case

No single piece of evidence proves everything. But together, they form a compelling cumulative case:

1. **Eyewitness testimony** (early, reliable)
2. **Documentary evidence** (99.5% textually pure, 24,000+ manuscripts)
3. **Corroborating sources** (non-Christian historians)
4. **Scientific evidence** (Jesus truly died, couldn't have swooned)
5. **Psychological evidence** (hallucinations don't explain resurrection appearances)
6. **Archaeological evidence** (confirms Gospel details)
7. **Historical consensus** (even enemies confirm key facts)
8. **Contemporary testimony** (lives transformed today)

**The Verdict:**

As Lee Strobel concluded after his investigation:

> **The evidence was absolutely convincing.**

---

## Invitation to Investigate

Don't take our word for it. Investigate yourself:

**Read:**
- *The Case for Christ* by Lee Strobel
- *Evidence That Demands a Verdict* by Josh McDowell
- *The Historical Jesus* by Gary Habermas

**Examine:**
- Archaeological evidence (Jerusalem sites, inscriptions)
- Non-Christian historical sources (Josephus, Tacitus)
- Manuscript evidence (manuscript count vs. other ancient works)

**Ask:**
- What would it take to convince you?
- Are you examining evidence objectively or protecting a conclusion?
- Have you honestly considered the resurrection evidence?

**Pray:**
> "Jesus, if you're real, reveal yourself to me. I'm willing to follow evidence wherever it leads."

God invites honest investigation:

> "Come now, let us reason together," says the LORD. — Isaiah 1:18 (ESV)

---

## Next Steps

Evidence examined, questions remain:

- **Why follow Jesus? What does it mean practically?** → [Why Follow Jesus](why-follow-jesus.draft.md)
- **What objections exist? How are they answered?** → [Objections Answered](objections-answered.draft.md)
- **What did Jesus accomplish?** → [Reconciliation and the New Covenant](reconciliation-and-covenant.draft.md)

The evidence points to Jesus. History supports the Gospels. The tomb is empty.

What will you do with the evidence?
